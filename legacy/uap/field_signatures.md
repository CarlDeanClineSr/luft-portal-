# UAP Sphere — Expected Field Signatures (Checklist)

Sensors
- RF/VNA sweep (0.1–6 GHz), polarization state, notch maps
- Magnetometers (±2000 nT range), 1–10 kHz sampling
- Optical spectrometer (350–900 nm), look for O+, N2+, continuum spikes
- Thermal IR (8–12 µm), annular vs core contrast
- GNSS/TEC logs for scintillation

Events to mark
- Approach of projectile/shock
- Maneuver onset
- “Bounce”/deflection instant

Pass/Fail cues
- RF: deep, agile notches; phase/polarization rotation → PASS
- MAG: synchronized spikes at maneuver/impact → PASS
- OPT: brief ionization lines at shell → PASS
- IR: annulus or cold‑skin signature → PASS
- GNSS: localized scintillation → SUPPORT
