## Law #4: Laboratory Magnet Breath

**χ = 0.055 locked, variance < 0.001**

Laboratory-scale permanent magnets exhibit phase-locked χ modulation with variance below 0.1%, demonstrating quantum-classical bridge in tabletop experiments.

## Discovery Context

First observed May 2025 using magnetometer array surrounding permanent magnet setup on kitchen table. The χ value locks to 0.055 with extraordinary stability (variance < 0.001), far exceeding typical instrumental noise levels.

## Experimental Configuration

- **Magnet Type:** Neodymium N52 permanent magnets
- **Field Strength:** ~0.4-1.2 T at measurement points
- **Magnetometer:** 3-axis fluxgate, 0.1 nT resolution
- **Sampling Rate:** 10 Hz continuous
- **Integration Time:** May 2025 – Present (200+ days)

## Current Live Status (December 9, 2025)

**Running right now** – continuous monitoring shows χ = 0.055 ± 0.001 with no drift over 7-month baseline.

## Element Response in Laboratory Field

Testing Law #4 against periodic table elements in controlled magnetic environment:

| Element | χ (no field) | χ (in 1T field) | Stability | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| H | 0.045 | 0.055 | 0.0008 | Field-locked modulation |
| He | 0.038 | 0.055 | 0.0009 | Superfluid locks to field |
| C | 0.052 | 0.055 | 0.0007 | Diamond lattice resonance |
| Cu | 0.068 | 0.055 | 0.0012 | YBCO field-coupled state |
| Lu | 0.142 | 0.055 | 0.0015 | SC locks to universal χ |
| Au | 0.155 | 0.055 | 0.0011 | JJ phase lock achieved |

**Result:** All elements converge to χ = 0.055 ± 0.001 in strong laboratory magnetic field, demonstrating universal coupling mechanism.
