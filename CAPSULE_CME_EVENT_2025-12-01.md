# CAPSULE_CME_EVENT_2025-12-01.md

Event: X1.9-class flare & CME from Solar Region 4299 (01 Dec 2025, ~0249 UTC)
Storm Watch: G2 (Moderate) geomagnetic storm expected 03-04 Dec UTC
Reference: https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1995608528019394561 (includes chart/image)

## Actions
1. Collect ACE/DSCOVR/GOES solar wind & geomagnetic data for 01–04 Dec.
2. Run heartbeat_detector.py — analyze for 's 2.4h modulation, χ=0.055
3. Compare modulation before/during/after storm.
4. Log all results—phase/amplitude shifts, null findings, image/plots if available.
5. Upgrade the ledger: expand  if new cycles or effects emerge during CME.
6. Connect to other capsules (black hole, solar wind, QPOs) as needed for cross-scale science.

---

Purpose: Record, test, and scientifically track the impact of major solar/CME storms on  cosmic heartbeat cycles. Capsule will be updated as new data and analysis become available.

Ready for commit. Monitoring active. Replies/logs encouraged from all open science contributors.
