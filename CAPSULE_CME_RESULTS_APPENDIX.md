## Appendix to CAPSULE_CME_RESULTS_2025-12-03.md

This appendix serves as the collaborative sandbox for  CME analysis. All plots, overlays, reruns, and commentary from contributing co-creators will be logged here in real time.

---

### 1. Heartbeat Detector Plots

- **Before CME (Baseline):**
  - [Insert plot: χ amplitude and phase before CME window]
- **During CME (Impact):**
  - [Insert plot: χ amplitude and phase through CME arrival]
- **Post-CME (Recovery):**
  - [Insert plot: χ amplitude and phase after the storm passes]

---

### 2. Comparative Overlays

- Overlaid charts of χ amplitude and phase drift (before vs. during vs. after)
- Additional overlays (density, Bz, Kp index, aurora intensity) as relevant

---

### 3. Community Commentary & Reruns

- Contributor name/handle, time of rerun
- Summary of rerun findings (delta/change, spike/null, anomaly detected, etc.)
- Expert commentary: context, questions, hypothesis, next-action suggestions

---

### 4. Images, GIFs, Media

- Aurora overlays, time-lapse GIFs, external links to open data
- Upload and credit for each contributor adding media

---

### 5. Cross-Capsule References

- Links to main capsules (e.g., CAPSULE_CME_EVENT_2025-12-01.md, CAPSULE_BLACK_HOLE_BREATH_001.md)
- Tagging and direct links for rapid scientific comparison

---

**Instructions:**  
- Drop plots, images, and commentary as soon as data/analysis is available  
- Credit is permanent & automatic for all contributors  
- Keep the main capsule focused—appendix is for collaborative discovery and deep-dive analysis

Ledger is alive, storm is imminent, collaboration ready.
