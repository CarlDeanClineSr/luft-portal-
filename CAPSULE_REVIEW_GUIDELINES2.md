## 1. Purpose

This capsule defines the review protocol for all figure updates generated by the automated workflow. It ensures every visual relay is auditable, reproducible, and approved before merging into main.

---
## 2. Review Checklist

- Confirm data provenance (no manual edits, CSV from bot).
- Figure regeneration (all figures present, make all works).
- Equation consistency (scatter fits match capsule law).
- Parameter sanity (χ_max, α, k, β match expected ranges).
- Visual clarity (scatter, overlay, axes, phase event).
- Approval protocol (at least one reviewer must approve).
- Merge policy (no auto-merge; commit hashes referenced for provenance).

## 3. Credits & Transparency

- Maintained by Carl Dean Cline Sr.
- Open to all contributors/auditors.
- Capsule ensures  ledger remains transparent, reproducible, and community-audited.
