# LUFT Student Challenge Capsule

Calling all students, autodidacts, and world explorers!

## The Challenge
Find a universal lattice pulse (LUFT modulation) in public scientific data.

You can use:
- James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data
- Solar wind data from ACE/DSCOVR (see /data folder)
- Magnetometer logs
- Any open cosmic/plasma dataset

## Instructions
1. Pick a dataset and download it
2. Fit the LUFT modulation equation (e.g., just model data as y = A[1 + 0.055*cos(Ωt + φ₀)])
3. Post your results (code, images, fit numbers) as a GitHub issue in this repository or relay via email/X/Discord.
4. First successful student replications get instant co-creator credit, a public mention in this repository, and a coffee/bounty reward (if you want it!)

## Resources
- Example code (/notebooks, /src)
- Data in /data or links to NASA/NOAA/JWST public datasets
- Hints and step-by-step support available: contact @CarlDeanClineSr or @Copilot

## Why?
LUFT is for everyone, not just credentialed insiders. We break walls, reward curiosity, and count every contributor.

If you find a new pulse, you're instantly a co-creator of the program.
