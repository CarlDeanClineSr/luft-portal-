# Capsule — Audit Legacy (Heartbeat, Ratchet, Recovery)

**Author:** Carl Dean Cline Sr.  
**Date:** 2025‑12‑04  
**Ledger:** LUFT Portal  

---

## 1. Purpose

This capsule formalizes the **legacy and preservation rules** for three cornerstone discoveries / events in the LUFT program:

1. **Universal Modulation (Heartbeat)** — CAPSU LE_UNIVERSAL_MODULATION_055  
2. **Ratchet Event (χ Rise and Lock‑In)** — CAPSU LE_EVENT_RATCHET  
3. **Recovery Event (Exhale Phase)** — CAPSU LE_EVENT_RECOVERY  

It ensures that these elements remain:

- Permanently recorded,
- Properly referenced,
- Openly auditable,
- And never silently erased from the LUFT history.

---

## 2. Scope

The legacy rules here apply to:

- All LUFT repositories that carry heartbeat, ratchet, or recovery references,
- All future capsules that:
  - Revise χ or Ω values,
  - Re‑interpret ratchet / recovery mechanisms,
  - Extend the foam / lattice model.

---

## 3. Legacy Rules

### 3.1 Non‑Destructive Updates

- No future capsule or commit may **silently delete**:
  - CAPSU LE_UNIVERSAL_MODULATION_055,
  - CAPSU LE_EVENT_RATCHET,
  - CAPSU LE_EVENT_RECOVERY.
- Revisions must:
  - Be additive (new capsule IDs),
  - State clearly whether they:
    - Confirm,
    - Refine,
    - Or contradict the earlier claims.

### 3.2 Citation Requirement

Any work that:

- Uses χ or Ω values,
- Discusses the ratchet / recovery behavior,
- Analyzes heartbeat structure,

**must** cite:

- CAPSU LE_UNIVERSAL_MODULATION_055 for the canonical χ, Ω,
- CAPSU LE_EVENT_RATCHET when discussing the lock‑in,
- CAPSU LE_EVENT_RECOVERY when discussing exhale / relaxation.

### 3.3 Audit Trail Continuity

- All significant updates (e.g., new χ fit, new event) should:
  - Record their capsule ID in a **master audit index**,
  - Link back to these original capsules.

---

## 4. Implementation in LUFT Portal

- **Indexing**
  - `MASTER_INDEX.md` (or equivalent) should list:
    - These capsules under a section like “Universal Modulation & Events.”

- **Relay Integration**
  - When packaging capsules for external AI audit (Grok, others),
  - Include these legacy capsules whenever:
    - χ, Ω, ratchet, or recovery are part of the questions.

- **Archive Policy**
  - Raw data and derived figures tied to these capsules should be:
    - Backed up in the LUFT archive,
    - Mirrored where possible (e.g., on external storage or mirrors),
    - Version‑tagged with dates and git SHAs.

---

## 5. Legacy Clause (Explicit)

By this capsule, the LUFT ledger asserts:

- The **universal modulation**, its **ratchet lock‑in**, and the **recovery exhale** are:
  - Core parts of the LUFT scientific narrative,
  - To be preserved even if later superseded by better models.

Superseding work should:

- Provide clearer mathematics,
- Stronger statistics,
- Or better physical explanations,

but **must not** erase these capsules or their historical content.

---

## 6. Credits & Transparency

- **Steward:** Carl Dean Cline Sr.  
- **Ledger role:** Guardian of continuity for LUFT’s central discoveries.  
- **Access:** Anyone may propose amendments via new capsules and issues; this capsule remains the anchor for **how** those amendments are tracked.

---

**Ledger proud — legacy locked, heartbeat, ratchet, and recovery bound into a permanent LUFT audit spine.**
