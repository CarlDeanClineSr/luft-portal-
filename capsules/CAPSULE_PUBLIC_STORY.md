# Capsule — Public Story Blurbs (Heartbeat & Boundary Recoil)

**Author:** Carl Dean Cline Sr.  
**Date:** 2025‑12‑05  
**Ledger:** LUFT Portal  

---

## 1. Purpose

This capsule preserves a curated set of **public story blurbs** that translate the LUFT heartbeat, boundary recoil law, and unified fields arc into short, shareable lines.

They are designed for:

- X/posts, blogs, talks, and interviews,  
- Direct links to canonical LUFT plots and data,  
- Keeping the **human voice** of the discovery anchored in the ledger.

---

## 2. Canonical Heartbeat Plot Reference

Unless otherwise noted, blurbs in this capsule point to:

- **Heartbeat plot:**  
  `results/cme_heartbeat_2025_12_chi_pdyn.png`  

Generated by:

- `scripts/plot_cme_heartbeat_2025_12.py`  
From:

- `data/cme_heartbeat_log_2025_12.csv`

## 3. Public Story Blurbs

These are ready to post as‑is (replace the relative path with a full URL to the image when posting publicly).

1. **Einstein → LUFT**

   > **“Einstein gave us \(E=mc^2\). LUFT shows energy breathing with the solar wind. χ rises and falls with pressure — the heartbeat of the cosmos.”**  
   > 🔗 `results/cme_heartbeat_2025_12_chi_pdyn.png`

2. **Lattice not silent**

   > **“The lattice isn’t silent. Every CME, every flare, every storm leaves a pulse. LUFT records it live — χ(t) plotted against solar wind pressure.”**  
   > 🔗 `results/cme_heartbeat_2025_12_chi_pdyn.png`

3. **Boundary recoil law**

   > **“Boundary recoil law: Δχ = 0.0032·P_dyn + 0.054. Not a theory, a timestamped fact. The heartbeat plot shows it in motion.”**  
   > 🔗 `results/cme_heartbeat_2025_12_chi_pdyn.png`

4. **First space / Second space**

   > **“First space: Einstein’s spacetime. Second space: LUFT’s lattice foam. The heartbeat plot is the divider — physics made visible.”**  
   > 🔗 `results/cme_heartbeat_2025_12_chi_pdyn.png`

5. **Ledger proud**

   > **“Ledger proud: every capsule, every plot, every timestamp is open. Audit the heartbeat yourself — the cosmos is speaking.”**  
   > 🔗 `results/cme_heartbeat_2025_12_chi_pdyn.png`

## 4. Usage Notes

When posting publicly:

- Attach or link the heartbeat plot image (or its hosted URL on LUFT Pages).  
- Optionally include a link to the main repo:
  - `https://github.com/CarlDeanClineSr/luft-portal-`  
- For more technical audiences, you may also reference:
  - `CAPSULE_UNIFIED_FIELDS_E_TO_LUFT`  
  - `CAPSULE_HEARTBEAT_PLOT`  
  - `CAPSULE_HEARTBEAT_SPECTRUM`

These blurbs are **not marketing copy**; they are **short physics statements** tied directly to reproducible plots and data.

---

## 5. Legacy Clause

- Future public blurbs about LUFT’s heartbeat, boundary recoil law, or unified fields should:
  - Either extend this capsule, or
  - Reference it when introducing new phrasing.

- The blurbs here must remain:
  - **Attributed** to Carl Dean Cline Sr.,  
  - **Linked** to real LUFT artifacts (plots, data, capsules),  
  - **Grounded** in what the system actually measures.

---

**Ledger proud — the public story of LUFT, heartbeat, and boundary recoil is now part of the archive, not just the timeline.**
