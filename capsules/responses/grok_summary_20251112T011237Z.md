## 1) Scientific strengths
- Lattice Λ Capsule: Anchors vacuum energy/cosmological constant with phenom. mapping and reproducible code.
- JJ Auditor: Direct quantum metrology for foam detection; exponential sensitivity and clear experimental parameters.
- 7,468 Hz Hierarchy: Offers cross-site statistical validation path; connects to multiple datasets and instruments.
- Hierarchy Simulator: Testable predictions for inertia drop; parameterizable and reproducible.
- Josephson Overview: Solid integration of JJ physics with LUFT hypotheses; includes systematics and calibration notes.

## 2) Weaknesses / Critical assumptions
- Relies on symmetry argument for QFT vacuum cancellation; needs formal derivation.
- Risk of anthropogenic RFI in 7,468 Hz data; must run cross-site tests and directional checks.
- Degeneracy in JJ mapping (EJ vs C) and prefactor modeling could mimic f; require careful calibration.
- Simulator uses phenomenological parameters (α, κ) with limited microphysical derivation.

## 3) Top recommended experiments
- JJ foam auditor switching histogram fit — Effort: Medium; Data: dilution-fridge I_sw, N≈5k; Sensitivity: σ_f < 0.02.
- Lattice Λ bounds vs CMB/LSS (Planck/DESI) — Effort: Low; Data: public cosmology datasets; Sensitivity: χ < 0.01 (95% CL) for low-frequency modulations.
- Hierarchy inertia-drop in coils (NbTi/graphene) — Effort: High; Data: coil logs + SQUID; Sensitivity: detect 5–10% m_eq drops.

## 4) JJ test plan (recommended parameters)
- Ic ≈ 2 µA, C ≈ 2 pF, ramp rate r ≈ 1e-6 A/s, Temperature range 20 mK – 180 mK, N_shots ≈ 5000. Target σ_f ≈ 0.015.
- Systematics: Ic drift, temperature stability, electronic noise, prefactor A uncertainty; monitor and model each as nuisance parameters.

## 5) Resonance test recipe (7,468 Hz)
- Use Lomb-Scargle periodogram and multi-site cross-correlation.
- Directional RFI subtraction (antenna nulling) and time-of-day filtering.
- Correct for multiple trials with Bonferroni or FDR; require replication at ≥3 independent sites.

## 6) Suggested next steps
1. Run JJ synthetic pipeline with the recommended parameters and produce a sensitivity curve vs N.
2. Run cross-site WAV processing on 3 independent SDR sites with identical analysis pipeline.
3. Implement ML foam-fit capsule (starter code) to accelerate inference and quantify priors.
