## 📊 CONTENT OVERVIEW

### The Discovery: χ ≈ 0.15

The documents establish:
- **Universal vacuum limit** of χ ≈ 0.15
- **99,397+ observations** with zero violations
- **Triple verification** across macro, micro, and biological scales
- **Unification** of gravity (1/χ = G), matter (χ = (mₑ/mₚ)^1/4), and biology (χ/α = 20.55 Hz)

### Evidence Presented

1. **Solar Proof** - DSCOVR, PSP, MAVEN data (max χ = 0.149)
2. **Collider Proof** - CERN/RHIC viscosity (η/s = 0.14)
3. **Biological Proof** - 20.55 Hz resonance frequency

### Applications

1. **Metric Engineering** - Cline Drive for propulsion
