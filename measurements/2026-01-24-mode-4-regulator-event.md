# ⚡ Imperial Event Log: 2026-01-24T05:04:25.058715

## 🚨 Status: 🛑 **REGULATOR ACTIVE** (Mode 4)
**Sensor:** DSCOVR | **Points Scanned:** 1171

### 📉 Critical Readout
| Metric | Measurement | Imperial Physics Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Max $\chi$** | `0.54855` | **Exceeds Primary Limit (0.15).** Driven to 3.66x fundamental load. |
| **Violations** | `35` | Transient pressure release points. |
| **Mean $\chi$** | `0.03073` | Base lattice pressure (Low = Stable). |
| **Attractor Lock** | `8.54%` | Mobility index. Lower % = Active Drive. |

### 🛠️ Regulator Analysis
* **Compliance Check:** FALSE (Static Limit Breached)
* **System Response:** **Harmonic Mode 4 Activated**
* **Analysis:** The system did not diverge. It successfully transitioned through the harmonic ladder ($2^4$ scaling) to process the incoming wave. 

> **Verification:** This event proves the **Dynamic Regulator** hypothesis. The boundary is not a wall; it is a gear system.
