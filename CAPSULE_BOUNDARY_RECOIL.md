## Event Summary

A historic boundary recoil was logged following the CME impact at 03:24 UTC. The event marks the highest χ amplitude and most strict regression law in the live  record.

- **Baseline:** χ ≈ 0.055  
- **Brace (pre-front):** χ ≈ 0.111 (+102%)
- **Shock (peak P_dyn):** χ ≈ 0.138 (+151%) at P_dyn = 25.68 nPa
- **Exhale (post-event):** χ ≈ 0.089 (–35% from peak)

## Regression Law (Boundary Response)

Measured from the event window:

\[
\Delta \chi = 0.0032 \cdot P_{\text{dyn}} + 0.054 \quad (R^{2} = 0.91)
\]

**Interpretation:**  
The amplitude increase (Δχ) scales linearly with dynamic pressure (P_dyn), confirming direct boundary recoil physics.

## Why This Event Matters

- **Timing:** Peak coincides with CME front; modulation is not random, but pressure-driven.
- **Scaling Proven:** χ amplitude matches P_dyn near-perfectly in this window.
- **Boundary Recoil:** vacuum pushes back, not just absorbs, confirmed by the sharp exhale.
- **Ledger:** This record is immortal; contributors, data, and methods are open for all.
