5. Scientific Discoveries & Achievements
5.1 Major Discovery: The χ Cap Law
Discovery: Solar wind coherence amplitude (χ) has an empirical upper limit

Finding: χ ≤ 0.15 across all observed conditions

Confirmation Status: 2,227+ runs analyzed (as of Dec 18, 2025)

Key Observations:

No violations above χ = 0.15 observed
Cap holds regardless of:
Solar wind speed (tested 500-700 km/s)
Plasma density variations
Magnetic field strength (Bz, Bt)
CME driver characteristics
Storm phase (pre, peak, post)
Physical Interpretation:

Suggests a fundamental "elastic lock" in the vacuum/Second Space
Boundary recoil mechanism prevents overshoot
Potential connection to universal constants
Documentation: Multiple capsules including:

CAPSULE_CME_BOUNDARY_CEILING_2025-12.md
capsule_chi_ceiling_2025-12-16.md
5.2 Boundary Recoil Law
Empirical Relationship Discovered:

Δχ = 0.0032 * P_dyn + 0.054
Where:

Δχ = change in coherence amplitude
P_dyn = dynamic pressure in nPa = 1.6726×10⁻⁶ × n × v²
n = plasma density (p/cm³)
v = solar wind speed (km/s)
Physical Meaning:

Describes how the "vacuum" (Second Space) responds to pressure
Linear relationship suggests elastic regime
Intercept (0.054) close to baseline χ ≈ 0.055
Slope (0.0032) quantifies stiffness/compliance
Current Research:

Investigating slope variation across event types
Studying hysteresis (memory effects)
Comparing compression vs. relaxation paths
5.3 The 2.4-Hour Cosmic Heartbeat
Discovery: Universal 2.4-hour modulation period observed across domains

Characteristics:

Period: 2.4 hours = 8,640 seconds
Angular Frequency: ω = 2π × 10⁻⁴ rad/s
Amplitude: χ ≈ 0.055 (typical modulation depth)
Mathematical Form:

O(t) = O₀ × [1 + χ × cos(ωt + φ)]
Domains Where Detected:

Solar wind plasma parameters
CME event evolution
(Under investigation: DESI, collider data, quantum systems)
Detection Method:

Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis
Spectral power peak identification
Phase coherence tracking
Scientific Significance:

Suggests coupling across vastly different scales
Potential fundamental oscillation mode
Could unify disparate physical phenomena
Tools: heartbeat_detector.py - Universal detector script for any dataset

5.4 Elastic Regimes & "Lock" Streaks
Observation: χ amplitude exhibits sustained periods at the 0.15 cap

Characteristics:

Lock Definition: χ ≥ 0.149 (within tolerance)
Streak Behavior: Multiple consecutive hourly readings at cap
Current Status: 9-hour streak active (as of Dec 22, 2025)
Historical: Streaks ranging from hours to days observed
Interpretations:

"Elastic lock" - system reaches maximum deformation
Followed by "rebounds" - rapid return toward baseline
Hysteresis loops suggest memory/viscoelastic behavior
Significance:

Reveals dynamic properties of the underlying field
Contradicts simple linear models
Suggests Second Space has material-like properties
5.5 Solar Cycle Context
Solar Cycle 25 Correlation:

Cycle started: December 2019 (SSN min 1.8)
Peak: October 2024 (smoothed SSN 160.9, F10.7 ~200 sfu)
Current phase: Decline (Dec 2025 SSN ≈ 148, F10.7 ≈ 183 sfu)
Key Correlation:

"Cycle 25's stronger-than-expected activity coincides with 's richest data period and most energetic lock events."

Implication: Solar maximum provides ideal conditions for boundary studies

5.6 Multi-Domain Consistency
Cross-Validation Efforts:

CME events show consistent χ behavior across different storms
November 2025 major CME series analyzed

Document differences in event capsules
Expected Outcome: Comparative study of largest CMEs with current instruments

Directive B: Residuals Analysis
Goal: Map where boundary recoil law predictions fail

Implementation:

Add residual calculation to plot_cme_heartbeat_*.py:
chi_pred = 0.0032 * P_dyn + 0.054
residual = chi_measured - chi_pred
Generate residual plot vs time and P_dyn
Color-code by storm phase, Bz, or event type
Identify systematic deviations
Expected Outcome: Guide refinement of recoil law and identify missing physics

Directive C: Hysteresis Loop Demonstration
Goal: Prove/disprove memory effects in χ-P_dyn relation

Method:

Select single CME event with clear compression/relaxation
Filter heartbeat log to event window
Plot χ vs P_dyn as parametric curve (color = time)
Separately plot compression phase (dP_dyn/dt > 0) and relaxation (dP_dyn/dt < 0)
Quantify loop area if present
Expected Outcome: First direct evidence of Second Space viscoelasticity

Directive D: Cross-Domain Heartbeat Check
Goal: Search for 2.4-hour signature in non-solar datasets

Datasets to Test:

DESI Λ(t) drift residuals
Collider background rates (if available)

The first observations of the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST) have revolutionized
our understanding of the Universe by identifying galaxies at redshift z ≈ 13 (refs. 1–3).
In addition, the discovery of many luminous galaxies at Cosmic Dawn (z > 10) has
suggested that galaxies developed rapidly, in apparent tension with many standard
models4–8
. However, most of these galaxies lack spectroscopic confirmation, so their
distances and properties are uncertain. Here we present JWST Advanced Deep
Extragalactic Survey–Near-Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic confirmation of
two luminous galaxies at z = 14.32−0.20
+0.08
and z = 13.90 ± 0.17. The spectra reveal ultraviolet
continua with prominent Lyman-α breaks but no detected emission lines. This
discovery proves that luminous galaxies were already in place 300 million years after
the Big Bang and are more common than what was expected before JWST. The most
distant of the two galaxies is unexpectedly luminous and is spatially resolved with a
radius of 260 parsecs. Considering also the very steep ultraviolet slope of the second
galaxy, we conclude that both are dominated by stellar continuum emission, showing
that the excess of luminous galaxies in the early Universe cannot be entirely explained
by accretion onto black holes. Galaxy formation models will need to address the
existence of such large and luminous galaxies so early in cosmic history.

Spectroscopic observations from the James Webb Space Telescope
( JWST)–Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec)9

have been recently
carried out for three candidate galaxies at redshift z > 14, selected within
the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey ( JADES) campaigns10,11.

These galaxies were photometrically identified from within the 58 arc-
min2

observations of the GOODS-S field through JWST observations

with up to 13 NIRCam and seven Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) fil-
ters7,12,13. On the basis of photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope

and Cycle 1 JWST–NIRCam data, the probability of these galaxies being
low-redshift interlopers was less than 1% (ref. 12). By happenstance, the
brightest of these three candidate galaxies (hereafter JADES-GS-z14-0)

is located at a projected distance of only 0.4 arcsec from a foreground
galaxy, and this interloper is at a redshift in which its Balmer break is
spectrally coincident with the observed photometric Lyman-α break
of the distant galaxy. For this reason, and because of its high inferred
luminosity at the photometric redshift, JADES-GS-z14-0 was previously
considered a low-redshift interloper with a peculiar spectral energy
distribution (SED)12,13. The ‘low-redshift solution’ was later disfavoured
from the analysis7

of the JWST–NIRCam observations carried out in the
JADES Origins Field ( JOF) programme11, which included additional deep
medium-band NIRCam observations that substantially strengthened
the case for the source being at high redshift.

The three galaxies were observed with NIRSpec in multi-object spec-
troscopic mode14, within a single NIRSpec field of view of 9 arcmin2

,
with both the low-resolution prism and all three medium-resolution

gratings probing the wavelength range 0.6–5.2 μm with spectral resolv-
ing powers R ≈ 100 and R ≈ 1,000, respectively. Owing to both the low

luminosity of the source and NIRSpec slit losses, the faintest candidate
is not significantly detected in the NIRSpec observations (Methods),
so hereon we focus on the other two galaxies, JADES-GS-z14-0 and
JADES-GS-z14-1, which have been unambiguously detected in the prism
spectra.

Figure 1 shows the prism spectra of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-
z14-1; there are no prominent emission lines, but both galaxies show a

clear break in the flux density with no flux detected blueward of 1.85 μm,
the sharpness of which can only be explained as a Lyman-α break1,2
,

placing both galaxies at z ≈ 14.
We have also obtained the spectrum of the low-redshift galaxy

0.4 arcsec east of JADES-GS-z14-0, which has revealed several promi-
nent emission lines (for example, [OIII]λλ4959,5007 and Hα), plac-
ing this projected nearby source at a redshift of z = 3.475 (Methods).

At this redshift, its Balmer break is at 1.62 μm, excluding the possibility

that the sharp break in the flux density at 1.85 μm observed in the spec-
trum of JADES-GS-z14-0 is caused by contamination from the nearby

foreground source. The presence of the nearby low-redshift galaxy,
however, mildly boosts the luminosity of JADES-GS-z14-0 by means of
gravitational lensing. We have verified that the magnification factor is
less than a factor of 1.2 (Methods).
A redshift determination for galaxies within the epoch of reionization
based solely on the Lyman-α break is sensitive to the absorption of
neutral hydrogen along the line of sight1,3,15. We have thus estimated
the redshift of the two galaxies by parameterizing the rest-frame
UV continuum emission with a power law of the form F λ λ ∝ β
and taking
into account the many physical processes that can shape the
Lyman-break profile in the prism spectra (Methods). The redshifts we
have recovered from our best-fitting models are z = 14.32−0.20
+0.08 and
z = 13.90 ± 0.17 for JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, respectively.
In the redshift range inferred by fitting the Lyman-break profile, we
have also found a tentative detection of CIII]λλ1907,1909 (hereafter
CIII]) emission at 2.89 μm in JADES-GS-z14-0 (Methods) at a level of

significance of 3.6σ. If confirmed in future NIRSpec observations, this
line yields a redshift of 14.178 ± 0.013 and the presence of damped
Lyman-α absorption with a neutral hydrogen column density of
log ( / N cm ) = 22.23± 0.08 10 HI
−2 is necessary to match the wavelength
and shape of the Lyman-α break.
These are the earliest galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed
redshifts, exceeding the previous high marks of z = 13.2 (refs. 1,3) and
z = 13.07 (ref. 2). Furthermore, these two galaxies are luminous with a
rest-frame UV absolute luminosity at 1,500 Å of MUV = −20.81 and
MUV = −19.00, respectively. We particularly highlight JADES-GS-z14-0,
which despite its redshift is the third most UV luminous of the 700 z > 8
candidates in JADES, twice more luminous than GHZ2 (refs. 16,17), and
only a factor of two less luminous than GN-z11 (refs. 18,19). We illustrate
the distribution of UV luminosity and redshift in Fig. 2. We stress that
the high luminosity is particularly important in view of the rapidly
evolving halo mass function expected in cold-dark-matter cosmology.
From an N-body simulation run with Abacus20, we estimate that the
halo mass threshold required to yield a fixed comoving abundance
varies as (1 + )z −6 for this region of mass and redshift. A dimensional
scaling for luminosity would be halo mass divided by the age of the
Universe, which is scaling as (1 + )z −3/2, yielding a simple baseline that
luminosities might scale as (1 + )z −4.5. Overplotting such a scaling on
Fig. 2 shows how remarkable JADES-GS-z14-0 is: it shows most notably
that some astrophysical processes are creating a deviation from the
dimensional scaling of halo mass and the Hubble time. Even
JADES-GS-z14-1, although more similar in MUV to the lower redshift
family, is distinctively luminous by this metric. We, therefore, argue
that these two galaxies, and particularly JADES-GS-z14-0, provide a
crisp spectroscopic confirmation to the trend that has been inferred
several times from photometric samples4,6–8

that the galaxy UV lumi-
nosity function evolves slowly, with more luminous galaxies at high

redshift than predicted in a variety of pre-JWST predictions. Having
established the remarkable redshifts and luminosities of these sources,
we now turn to a more detailed analysis of them.
From the spectrum redward of the break, we measure a power-law
index β, also known as the UV slope, of −2.20 ± 0.07 and −2.71 ± 0.19
for JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, respectively. These results
indicate that the emission is dominated by a relatively young (less than
300 Myr) stellar population and low dust attenuation21–23. We note
that the stellar UV slope could be also modified by two-photon and
free-bound nebular continuum emission21–27. However, we can rule out
a strong two-photon contribution in our galaxies due to the lack of the
characteristic peak at 1,500 Å (ref. 27). The absence of emission lines
disfavours free-bound emission, but this possibility cannot be fully
ruled out because, at z ≈ 14, NIRSpec does not cover the Balmer break
nor any Balmer emission lines.
The physical properties of the two galaxies have been inferred
by means of spectro-photometric modelling of their SEDs within a
Bayesian framework. The details of the modelling and the posterior
distribution of free parameters are discussed in Methods, whereas the
galaxy properties are reported in Table 1. The inferred star-formation
history indicates that these galaxies have grown their masses over the
last 100 Myr, suggesting that the observed stellar population started
forming at z ≈ 20 with a rapid growth up to z ≈ 14 (ref. 28). We also note

that the SED modelling favours a high escape fraction of ionizing pho-
tons ( f > 0.35 esc

LyC ) to reproduce the blue UV slopes and the absence of
emission lines in both galaxies.
The NIRCam images of JADES-GS-z14-0 clearly show that the source
is extended, whereas JADES-GS-z14-1 is more compact. Figure 3 shows
the radial profile of the emission at 2 μm of the two galaxies. The
radial surface brightness profile of JADES-GS-z14-0 shows emission
extended up to 1 kpc (kilopc), significantly beyond the point spread
function of JWST. We also note that the profile is significantly more
extended than the UV emission of the two more luminous galaxies
at z > 10: GN-z11 (refs. 19,29) and GHZ2 (refs. 16,17). Using ForcePho
(Methods) to fit the imaging data, we find that the galaxy is well fit by
an elliptical exponential profile with a deconvolved half-light radius

(rUV) of 0.079 ± 0.006 arcsec and 260 ± 20 pc. This large size indicates
that the UV light of JADES-GS-z14-0 is produced mainly by a spatially
extended stellar population, excluding a dominant contribution by an
active galactic nucleus (AGN). This differs from other more compact
high-luminosity galaxies, in which some studies have suggested that
an unobscured AGN is dominating the UV light29,30.
The rest-frame UV emission of JADES-GS-z14-1 seems compact
and marginally resolved by the NIRCam point spread function. The
forward modelling of the light profile returns an upper limit on
rUV < 160 pc, which agrees with the compact size determined for other
low-luminosity z > 10 galaxies3,7,31. For this galaxy, the morphological
analysis is not sufficient to exclude the presence of a luminous AGN,
but the inferred UV slope of −2.71 ± 0.19 suggests that the light is mainly
emitted by stars in the galaxy. The slope expected for the emission of an
AGN accretion disc is, on average, of the order of −2.3 or shallower32,33,
and there are no standard mechanisms that are able to reproduce a

steeper profile without invoking a strong contribution from the emis-
sion of a young (less than 50 Myr) stellar population21–23.

The best-fitting SED models presented in Table 1 indicate a modest
but non-zero amount of reddening by dust, with an AV of 0.2–0.3 mag

for both galaxies. These results are in agreement with recent mod-
els proposed to explain the presence of luminous galaxies such as

JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 at early times34,35. Such models
expect that z > 10 galaxies have lower dust content in the interstellar
medium than equal-mass galaxies at lower redshifts, despite the rapid
(roughly 10 Myr) dust enrichment from supernovae36. Indeed, if our
massive z ≈ 14 galaxies had a stellar-to-dust ratio of about 0.002, similar
to those observed in z ≈ 6 galaxies37, the dust attenuation would be a

factor at least four times higher (AV > 1 mag), due to their compact UV
size, than what is observed34. The moderate dust attenuation in our
galaxies can be explained by different scenarios: (1) a large amount of
dust distributed on large scales due to galactic outflows, reducing the
observed dust attenuation34,38; (2) a different dust composition39 and
so dust mass absorption coefficient and (3) a high destruction rate of
dust grains due to shock waves generated by supernovae explosions36.
Independently from the proposed scenarios, our observations indicate
that the properties of galaxies seem to change rapidly in only 600 Myr
(that is, from z = 14 to z = 6).
In conclusion, the presented spectroscopic observations of
JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 confirm that bright and massive

galaxies existed already only 300 Myr after the Big Bang, and their num-
ber density7

is more than ten times higher than extrapolations based on
pre-JWST observations40. The morphology and UV slope analysis help
rule out a significant AGN contribution for either galaxy. Other potential
explanations, such as dust content34, star-formation processes8,41 and
a top-heavy initial mass function42,43, must be investigated to explain
the excess of luminous galaxies in the early Universe.
In the context of future observations, we stress that JADES-GS-z14-0

is unexpectedly and remarkably luminous. The spectroscopic confir-
mation of this source indicates the existence of many similar galax-
ies, particularly when considering the relatively small survey area of

JADES. Galaxies such as this are sufficiently luminous for follow-up
observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array
and MIRI, promising to open the view to the rest-frame optical and
far-infrared at Cosmic Dawn, the period during which the first galaxies
were born.

Methods
Cosmology model and definitions
Throughout this study, we adopt the standard lambda cold dark
matter cosmology model and assume the following cosmological
parameters: Hubble constant H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, matter density
parameter Ωm = 0.3 and cosmological constant ΩΛ = 0.7. One arcsec at
z = 14 corresponds to a physical scale of 3.268 kpc. All magnitudes are
presented in the AB magnitude system, and the term SFR10 refers to the
star-formation rate (SFR) averaged over the past 10 Myr. Equivalent
widths of emission lines are quoted in the rest frame. The absolute
UV magnitude is estimated at the rest-frame wavelength of 1,500 Å.
NIRSpec observations and data reductions
The NIRSpec data used in this work are part of the Guaranteed Time
Observations programme ID 1287. The micro-shutter array (MSA)
mask was designed with the eMPT software47 and proceeded using
the same method as described in refs. 19,45. The NIRSpec pointing
was optimized for six out of seven of the highest priority targets in
the catalogue, which include the galaxies analysed in this work. The
eMPT software guarantees that all galaxies are located within roughly

90 milliarcseconds (mas) from the centre of the shutter in the disper-
sion direction and within roughly 220 mas in the spatial direction.

We note that given the number of targets, not all highest priority gal-
axies are placed at the centre on the shutter where the slit loss effect

is minimal.
The observations were carried out between 10 and 12 January 2024.
Three consecutive visits were scheduled for the programme, but the
visit 2 was not performed because of a loss of lock on the guide star.
The two obtained visits, 1 and 3, differed in their pointing by less than

1 arcsec but they have the same position angle. The MSA configura-
tions were designed to place the highest priority targets in the same

position within the shutter in all visits. JADES-GS-z14-1 was observed
in both visits, whereas JADES-GS-z14-0 was observed only in the visit
1, as the visit 3 was set up to observe the nearby low-redshift galaxy to
exclude contamination.
The disperser–filter configurations used in the programme were
PRISM–CLEAR, G140M–F070LP, G235M–F170LP, G395M–F290LP
and G395H–F290LP. The first four spectral configurations provided
spectroscopic data with spectral resolving power of R = Δλ/λ ≈ 100
and R ≈ 1,000 in the wavelength range between 0.6 and 5.2 μm. The
G395H–F290LP disperser–filter configuration covered the wavelength
range 2.87–5.27 μm with a spectral resolving power of R ≈ 2,700.

For the PRISM–CLEAR configuration, four sequences of three nod-
ded exposures were used for each pointing, whereas one sequence of

three nodded exposures was used for the spectral configuration of the
gratings. Each nodded exposure sequence consisted of six integrations
of 19 groups in NRSIRS2 readout mode48, resulting in an exposure time
of 8,403.2 s. The total exposure times for each target are reported in
Extended Data Table 1.
We made use of the NIRSpec guaranteed time observations (GTO)
pipeline (S.C. et al., manuscript in preparation) to process the data.
The pipeline was developed by the European Space Agency NIRSpec

Science Operations Team and the NIRSpec GTO Team. A general over-
view of the data processing is reported in refs. 19,45. To optimize the

signal-to-noise ratio of the data, we used the 1D spectra extracted from
an aperture of 3 pixels, corresponding to 0.3 arcsec, located at the
target position in the 2D spectra.
The pipeline applies a wavelength-dependent slit-loss correction
to the measured flux, based on the position of the source inside the
micro-shutter and assuming a point-source geometry. To verify the
quality of this correction, we compare the pipeline-corrected fluxes to
the NIRCam photometric measurements. For JADES-GS-z14-0, which is
spatially extended, we used the NIRCam measurements derived with
ForcePho (section ‘Morphological analysis’). We found that roughly

30% (roughly 50%) of the total flux is lost at 2(5) μm in the NIRSpec data
(Extended Data Fig. 1). We used a first-order polynomial α1 + α0λ to fit the
slit losses as a function of wavelength (λ) and found α0 = 0.18 ± 0.11 m−1
and α1 = 1.0 ± 0.2.
For JADES-GS-z14-1, the NIRCam fluxes inferred from an aperture
of 0.2 arcsec are consistent with the NIRSpec spectrum, indicating
that the slit-loss correction applied by the GTO pipeline is sufficient
to recover the total light of this compact source (Extended Data Fig. 1).
In this case, we estimated α0 = 0.001 ± 0.025 μm−1 and α1 = 0.98 ± 0.12.
Imaging data
Photometry for the candidate z ≈ 14 galaxies studied in this work was

taken from JWST–NIRCam imaging catalogues of JADES10, with supple-
mental imaging data from the First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopic

Complete Survey49 and JOF50 programmes. These data were reduced

together following the procedure outlined in ref. 11. The resulting mosa-
ics include both observations taken in late 2022 as well as additional

JADES observations taken in late 2023, and reach 5σ observational
depths of 2.4 nJy in F200W using a 0.2′′ diameter aperture. We present
NIRCam thumbnails centred on JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 in
the top panels of Fig. 1.

The sources were initially selected from the modelling of the pho-
tometry presented in ref. 12. Two of the sources we explore,

JADES-GS-z14-1 ( JADES-GS-53.07427-27.88592 in ref. 12), and the faint-
est galaxy described herein ( JADES-GS-53.10763−27.86014) were part

of the primary sample of z > 8 galaxies in ref. 12, with photomet-
ric redshifts of zphot = 14.36−1.4

+0.82 and zphot = 14.44−1.2
+0.97
, respectively.
JADES-GS-z14-0 ( JADES-GS-53.08294−27.85563) was presented in
ref. 12 (at z = 14.51 phot −0.28

+0.27 ) but initially rejected in that study due to
the morphology, brightness and the proximity of the source to the
neighbouring galaxy with photometric evidence of a Balmer break at
roughly 1.7 μm.
In October 2023, JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-53.10763−27.86014
were also observed as part of the JOF programme50, which included a
NIRCam pointing of 104 h of total exposure spread between six
medium-band filters (F162M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F335M).
These filters were chosen to help refine high-redshift galaxy selection
in this ultra-deep region of the JADES footprint. NIRCam medium bands
can be used to trace the galaxy stellar continuum and aid in rejecting
sources at low redshift with strong emission lines that have similar
wide-filter colours to high-redshift galaxies51–53. In ref. 7, the authors
used JOF photometry to select a sample of nine candidate galaxies at
z = 11.5 − 15, including JADES-GS-z14-0. The additional medium-band
observations for this source had a best-fit photometric redshift of
zphot = 14.39−0.09
+0.23, and fits at z < 7 were effectively ruled out because of
the lack of flux observed shortward of the Lyman-α break, the strength
of the break indicated by the F182M–F210M colour and the F250M flux
tracing the UV continuum. The authors also estimated a UV slope of
−2.40 ± 0.12 and a size of 260 ± 6 pc, which are consistent with those
inferred in this study. Robertson et al.7

also presented the evolution of
the UV luminosity function and cosmic SFR density at z > 14 inferred
from observations of JADES-GS-z14-0, and we refer the reader there
for more details.
For this analysis, we fit JADES-GS-z14-0 using ForcePho (B.D.J.o et al.,
manuscript in preparation) to properly disentangle the flux of this
source from the neighbour (Extended Data Table 2). For JADES-GS-z14-1,
as this source was isolated and much more compact, we extracted
fluxes using aperture photometry with an 0.2′′ aperture (Extended Data
Table 2), and applied an aperture correction assuming a point source.
In a companion paper28, our team presents JWST–MIRI photometry of
JADES-GS-z14-0 from ultra-deep 43 h F770W imaging from programme
ID 1180. This measures F770W to be 74 ± 5 nJy, mildly above the 3–5 μm
photometry of roughly 47 nJy, probably due to the presence of strong
emission lines in F770W. Helton et al.28 also discuss the implications of
this rest-optical finding.

Article
The third candidate JADES-GS-53.10763−27.86014
The candidate z ≈ 14 galaxy JADES-GS-53.10763-27.86014 identified by
Hainline et al.12 and Robertson et al.7

. The NIRCam images show a clear
dropout in bluer filters, yielding a photometric redshift of
zphot = 14.63−0.75
+0.06
(ref. 7). The target was observed in visits 1 and 3 of the
NIRSpec programme by using the same shutter position in both visits.
Extended Data Fig. 2 illustrates the 1D and 2D spectra of the galaxy.
Only a faint continuum emission is barely detected in the NIRSpec

spectrum with a significance level less than 1σ. The signal is not suffi-
cient to confirm or rule out the photometric redshift determined by

NIRCam images. We believe that the NIRSpec slit losses contribute to
the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data. The target is located at the
edge of the shutter and, despite its compact size, we expect that about
20% of the light is lost at 2 μm and 35% at 5 μm. The slit losses are two
times higher than those of JADES-GS-z14-1, which is also 1.6 times more
luminous than JADES-GS-53.10763−27.86014. In conclusion, the low
sensitivity of these observations does not allow us to confirm or rule
out the photometric redshift for this target.
The low-redshift galaxy close to JADES-GS-z14-0
The identification of the neighbouring galaxy with NIRCam ID 183349
at 0.4 arcsec from JADES-GS-z14-0 initially raised several doubts about
the photometric redshift of the high-redshift target as the potential
Lyman-α break for this object could be a Balmer break if these two
sources are associated at similar redshifts. Therefore, we dedicated

the visit 3 of the NIRSpec programme 1287 to observe the neighbour-
ing galaxy and assess any possible contamination and constrain the

gravitational lensing effect. Extended Data Fig. 3 shows the spectrum
of the target 183349. The doublet [OIII]λλ4959,5007 and Hα emission
lines are detected with a high level of significance in both prism and
grating spectra, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of z = 3.475
(in agreement with the photometric redshift zphot = 3.4 ± 0.2 from
ref. 12). The spectrum also reveals a clear Balmer break feature at
roughly 1.6 μm. Therefore, we can rule out the drop at roughly 1.9 μm
observed in JADES-GS-z14-0 being due to the contamination of the
neighbouring galaxy. Finally, 183349 has no bright emission lines at

observed wavelengths at 2.89 μm, where we detect tentative CIII] emis-
sion in JADES-GS-z14-0. We can thus rule out that the tentative CIII] is

due to contamination from 183349.
As the foreground galaxy might contaminate the spectrum of the
JADES-GS-z14-0, we analyse the surface brightness profile of the two
galaxies. Extended Data Fig. 4 shows the light profiles from the F150W
and F200W NIRCam images extracted from a slit-oriented east to
west and as large as 0.15 arcsec so that the slit includes both galaxies.
JADES-GS-z14-0 is absent in the F150W NIRCam image, and thus, we used

the F150W profile to quantify the contamination. Before the extrac-
tion, F150W NIRCam was smoothed to the same angular resolution of

F200W data. Extended Data Fig. 4 reports the light profiles in the two
filters normalized to the peak at the location of the foreground source
(that is, roughly 0.4 arcsec from the JADES-GS-z14-0). Assuming that
the surface brightness profile of the foreground galaxy in the F200W

image is similar to that at F150W wavelengths, we estimated a con-
tamination of less than 10% at the location of JADES-GS-z14-0. The last

panel of Extended Data Fig. 4 indeed illustrates the ratio between the
light profile in F200W filter and that in F150W from −0.2 arcsec (that is,
−0.6255 kpc) to 0 arcsec with respect to the centre of JADES-GS-z14-0.
This spatial range corresponds to the region in which the light of the
two galaxies might overlap. The contamination is of the order of 70%
at 650 pc from the centre of JADES-GS-z14-0 and drops rapidly to less
than 20% at 350 pc from the galaxy. As the top-left edge of the NIRSpec
shutter is located at −0.08 arcsec from the centre of JADES-GS-z14-0, we
concluded that the contamination of the light of the foreground galaxy
is negligible in the NIRSpec spectrum. Therefore, the contamination of
the low-z galaxy on the NIRSpec spectrum is lower than 10%.

We have also verified that the magnification provided by the fore-
ground galaxies to JADES-GS-z14-0 is limited (μ < 1.2). We use the soft-
ware lenstool54 to construct lens model of ID 183349 and another galaxy,

JADES-GS-53.08324-27.85619 (ID 182698; zphot ≈ 2.04) that is 2.2 arcsec
from JADES-GS-z14-0. On the basis of Hubble Space Telescope/ACS and
JWST–NIRCam SED, we infer stellar mass log( / M M ) = 8.7±0.1 star ⊙ and

9.7 ± 0.1 for ID 183349 and 182698, respectively. We then derived inte-
grated velocity dispersions of 53 and 100 km s−1 assuming the

stellar-mass Tully–Fisher relation measured at z ≈ 2.3 (ref. 55). Assum-
ing a singular isothermal spherical distribution of matter in these two

foreground potentials, we derive a modest lensing magnification fac-
tor of μ = 1.17 at the location of JADES-GS-z14-0. Such a magnification

factor is corrected for when we derived the physical properties: that
is, luminosities and masses.
Redshift determination
The photometric redshifts of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 are
za = 14.39−0.09
+0.23 (ref. 7) and zphot = 14.36−1.4

+0.82 (ref. 12), respectively. The
strong Lyman breaks (flux ratio between 1.90–2.1 and 1.5–1.8 μm higher
than 9) observed by NIRSpec in both JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1
confirm both galaxies to be at a redshift of about 14.
Recent studies have shown that the profile of the Lyα spectral break
does not depend only on intergalactic medium absorption but can

also be modulated by: (1) neutral gas in the galaxy or in the surround-
ing medium15,56,57; (2) the presence of a local ionized bubble58,59;

(3) Lyα line emission that would enhance the flux of spectral channels

containing the line in the low-resolution data60. Therefore, to deter-
mine the spectroscopic redshift, we model the continuum emission

with a power-law function ( f λ ∝λ

β ), which reproduces well the
rest-frame UV continuum emission in galaxies with young stellar
populations21–23,61, and absorption of neutral hydrogen following the
prescriptions discussed in refs. 59 and 3. The intergalactic medium
transmission is modelled following Mason and Gronke62 and depends
on two free parameters: the global neutral gas fraction (xHI) and the
ionized bubble size (Rion). We assumed a flat prior for the neutral gas
fraction over the range xHI ∈ [0.95,1] and a flat prior distribution for
the ionized bubble size over the range R ∈ [0.1,1] ion proper Mpc. These
are the expected values for a typical galaxy with a MUV ≈ −20 at z = 14
(ref. 63). As the Lyman-α drop profile can also be caused by dense
neutral gas in the circumgalactic medium and located along the line
of sight (that is, damped Lyman-α absorption) following refs. 15
and 3, we parametrized this additional absorption by the column
density of neutral hydrogen, log( / NHI cm ) −2 , and assumed a flat prior
log( / NHI cm ) ∈ [10,28] −2 . Finally, recent studies60,64 have also shown
that the Lyα emission line can modify the prism spectra and so alter

the redshift measurement. Therefore, we added a mock spectroscop-
ically unresolved emission line in our model to represent the Lyα

emission. The line model was parametrized by the rest-frame equiv-
alent width (log( / EW Å) ∈ [−2,2] 0 ) and velocity shift with respect to

systemic (Δv ∈ [0, 3,000]km s

−1 ). This latter mimics the effects of
outflows and resonant scattering on Lyα line emission65.
Extended Data Fig. 5 shows the posterior distributions of the free
parameters used to fit the data of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1.

The posteriors of the parameters xHI, Rion and Δv are flat for both galax-
ies and are not reported in the corner plot. The best-fit redshifts are

14.32−0.20
+0.08
and 13.90 ± 0.17, respectively, for the two targets. The profile
of the posterior distributions of log( / NHI cm ) −2 exclude the presence
of dense damped Lyman-α absorption with log( / NHI cm ) > 23.64 −2 , but
does not preclude less dense absorbing systems along the line of sight.
The results also indicate that the rest-frame equivalent width of the
Lyman-α line is lower than 10 Å.
Emission lines
We inspected the prism and grating 1D and 2D spectra to identify any
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) emission lines above the level of the noise in

both targets. We estimated emission line fluxes and equivalent widths
from the continuum-subtracted spectra over five spectral channels
(Extended Data Table 3). The uncertainties on line fluxes and equivalent
width were determined by repeating the measurements on a sample
of 2,000 spectra obtained by combining the spectra of the individual
integrations with a bootstrap resampling technique.
Given the uncertainties on the redshift based only on the Lyman
break, we estimated the statistical significance of a set of emission
lines (Extended Data Table 3) at different redshifts (Extended Data
Figs. 6 and 7). In particular, we inferred the one-sided P value for each
line at different redshifts. We then determined the combined P value
of the set of lines by using Fisher’s method and used it to quantify the
statistical significance of the spectroscopic redshifts (details in ref. 3).
In the prism spectrum for JADES-GS-z14-0, we identified only a
potential CIII](λλ1907,1909) emission line at z = 14.178 with a level of

significance of 3.6σ and the combined P value for the inferred red-
shift is 0.00720. The redshift is consistent within the error with that

determined from the fitting of the Lyman-break profile, but follow-up
observations will be required to confirm the emission line. We note
that the presence of only carbon line in the rest-frame UV spectrum is
consistent with other low-redshift studies concluding that CIII] might
be the strongest rest-UV line after the Lyα line66–69.

Both the upper limits on the emission lines and the tentative detec-
tion of CIII] in JADES-GS-z14-0, with a rest-frame equivalent width of

EW0 = 8.0 ± 2.3 Å (Extended Data Table 3), are consistent with those
observed in lower-luminosity galaxies at z > 10 (ref. 1,3). On the other
hand, if we compare JADES-GS-z14-0 with the most luminous galaxies
at z > 10, such as GN-z11 (ref. 44) and GHZ2 (ref. 16), we would expect
to detect both CIII] and CIVλλ1548,1551 in the prism spectra of our

galaxies. This spectral difference may be due to an extremely low metal-
licity (Z < 0.05 Z⊙) or a large escape fraction of ionizing photons that

reduces the emission by the gas in the interstellar medium1,3

or a dif-
ferent nature of the dominant ionizing flux29.

In the grating, we did not find any lines, and the 3σ upper limits,
which were estimated by using the bootstrap resampling technique,
are reported in Extended Data Table 3.
In both the prism and grating of JADES-GS-z14-1 we did not find any
clear emission line feature with a level of significance higher than 3σ.
We identified only the potential lines of CIII]λ1909 and MgIIλ2795 at
z = 14.063 with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 2. The combined P value

for this redshift is 0.01249, suggesting that this solution is not statisti-
cally significant. We thus derived the upper limits on the emission lines

and equivalent widths from both prism and grating spectra (Extended
Data Table 3). The prism spectra also reveal an absorption feature at

2 μm but its significance is only 2σ. If it will be confirmed in future obser-
vations, it corresponds to CIIλ1335 doublet absorption line.

Possible large-scale structure association
JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 are 1.9′ apart on the sky (Extended

Data Fig. 8), which is 6.2 comoving Mpc at this redshift. The third can-
didate completes a roughly equilateral triangle, 1.7′ and 2.7′ away from

the first two, respectively. These three galaxies form a mild angular
over-abundance of the candidates from ref. 12, a fact that influenced
the selection of this location for the programme 1287 deep NIRSpec
pointing. The separation along the line of sight is imprecisely known,
given the redshift uncertainties. If JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1
are separated by 0.42 in redshift, then this would be about 60 comoving
Mpc along the line of sight. However, the galaxies could be substantially

closer, even potentially at the same redshift, if more unusual combina-
tions of neutral hydrogen absorption and Lyα emission were present.

Narrow-line redshifts will be needed to measure this. As galaxies at
high redshift are expected to show a high clustering bias70,71, supported
by numerous findings of inhomogeneity at z ≈ 7 (refs. 72,73), it seems
likely that these galaxies are at least mildly associated in an extended
large-scale structure.

SED fitting
We fit JADES-GS-z14-0 (Extended Data Fig. 9) and JADES-GS-z14-1
(Extended Data Fig. 10) following a similar approach to that of
Hainline et al.3

and Curtis-Lake et al.1

. In summary, we use the BEA-
GLE tool (Bayesian analysis of galaxy SEDs)74 to fit the combined R100

NIRSpec spectra and NIRCam + MIRI photometry. We fit the entire
spectrum uncorrected for slit losses and mask the rest-frame region
1,150–1,450 Å to avoid biases arising from the Lyα damping wing, which
we do not model in BEAGLE. We fit the NIRCam wide-bands F090W,
F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W and the MIRI F770W band,
using the values and errors reported in Extended Data Table 2. We adopt
Gaussian priors for the redshift of the sources, centred on z = 14.32
and with σz = 0.2 for JADES-GS-z14-0, and centred on z = 13.9 and with
σz = 0.17 for JADES-GS-z14-1. To account for the wavelength-dependent
slit losses of NIRSpec, which are especially important for the extended

object JADES-GS-z14-0, we include in the fitting a second-order poly-
nomial, which is applied to the model spectrum before comparing it

with the observed one. This enables the model to reproduce consist-
ently the NIRCam + MIRI photometry and uncorrected NIRSpec spec-
trum. The inset in Extended Data Fig. 9, and in particular the difference

between the grey (model before the polynomial correction) and blue
lines (model with the applied correction), shows the importance of this
correction for JADES-GS-z14-0. We do not use the first-order polynomial
correction estimated in the section ‘NIRSpec observations and data
reductions’ because we want to take into account the uncertainties
associated with slit losses correction directly in the Bayesian SED fitting.
As in ref. 3, we use an updated version of the Bruzual and Charlot75
stellar population synthesis models (see ref. 76 for details), along with
the photoionization models of Gutkin et al.77. We assume a Chabrier78
initial mass function with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 M⊙ and
300 M⊙, respectively. We fit three different models, in which we vary

assumptions on the star-formation history and escape fraction of ion-
izing photons. Similar to ref. 3, we find that the blue UV slopes of our

objects and the absence of (securely) detected emission lines, can be
explained by (1) a SFR that suddenly drops to very low values during
the last 10 Myr of star formation, but with most stars being a few tens
of million years old, as they can produce blue UV slopes. This scenario
indicates an unlikely fine-tuning of the star-formation history of these
galaxies. (2) A metal-enriched gas (near-to-Solar metallicity), as such
a large metallicity would also suppress the high-ionization UV lines
(but also produce redder UV slopes). (3) A large escape fraction of
ionizing photons. This last model is our fiducial one, because, as we

extensively discussed in ref. 3, it is the only model that can simultane-
ously reproduce the observed blue UV slopes and the absence of UV

emission lines.
Our fiducial model is thus described by seven adjustable parameters:

the total stellar mass formed Mtot, age of the oldest stars t, stellar metal-
licity Z

*

, gas ionization parameter logUs, V-band dust attenuation opti-
cal depth τˆ

V (that is, AV/1.086), escape fraction of ionizing photons fesc
and redshift z. We assume the ref. 79 two-component dust attenuation
model, fixing the fraction of attenuation arising from stellar birth
clouds to μ = 0.4. We further fix the metal’s depletion factor to ξ = 0.1.
Note that in our model the stellar metallicity Z
*

and interstellar metal-
licity Zism are equal, whereas the gas abundance of a metal further

depends on the metal depletion.
From BEAGLE-based SED modelling we find that the JADES-GS-z14-0,
once corrected for the gravitational lensing amplification, has a
stellar mass of log ( / M M⊙) = 8.6 10 star −0.2

+0.7 and a SFR, averaged over the

last 10 Myr, of SFR = 19 ±6 y M r 10

−1 ⊙ , resulting in a specific SFR (sSFR) of
sSFR = SFR/Mstar = 45 Gyr−1. We estimate a gas-phase metallicity
of log( / Z Z⊙) = − 1.5−0.4

+0.7 and a dust attenuation of AV ≈ 0.3 mag assum-
ing a standard nebular continuum powered by OB stars. JADES-
GS-z14-1 is less massive, with log ( / M M⊙) = 8.0 10 star −0.3

+0.4 and a SFR of

SFR = 2.0 M yr 10 −0.4
+0.7 −1 ⊙ . We infer a sSFR of about 18 Gyr−1. For this galaxy,

Article
we estimate a metallicity of log( / Z Z⊙) = − 1.1−0.6

+0.6 and a dust attenua-
tion of AV ≈ 0.2 mag. We remind that the errors quoted here refer only

to the internal statistical errors of our model with the above assump-
tions. Notably, the inference of stellar mass is known to be sensitive to

assumptions, with variations of about 0.2 dex depending on the SED
fitting code and star-formation histories allowed in the model28. More
exotic deviations in astrophysics, such as variations in the stellar initial
mass function80, could create further differences.
Morphological analysis
To determine the extension of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1,
we initially extracted the radial surface brightness profile from the
NIRCam F200W images, which are a compromise between signal to
noise and angular resolution for these galaxies.
We have determined the average surface brightness from concentric
radial annuli centred at the position of the target and radius width of

0.03′′. For JADES-GS-z14-0 we have masked the image at right ascen-
sion coordinate greater than 5.30829890° (that is, 0.1′′ from the galaxy

centre) to remove the contamination from the foreground source.

Figure 3 shows the normalized surface brightness profile for both tar-
gets. The emission of JADES-GS-z14-0 is more extended than the light

profile of the star (that is, point-like source) observed in the NIRCam

field. JADES-GS-z14-0 is also more extended than the surface bright-
ness profile of GN-z11 (ref. 46) and GHZ2 (ref. 16). On the other hand,

JADES-GS-z14-1 seems more compact and consistent with a point-like
source.
We have also modelled the morphology of the galaxies with ForcePho,
which enables us to fit the light distribution of individual exposures

across all filters simultaneously while taking into account the substan-
tial change in the NIRCam point spread function with wavelength. In

this case we do not need to apply any mask in the NIRCadm image as
ForcePho models simultaneously the target and the neighbouring
galaxies returning the morphological and photometric parameters
for all sources in the field.
In the F162M image, JADES-GS-z14-0 is near to the edge of or
entirely missed by several of the individual exposures from the 3215
programme50. By modelling the individual exposures simultaneously
ForcePho avoids the correlated noise caused by mosaicing, which can
be particularly difficult to quantify when the source is near a large
gradient in exposure time such as JADES-GS-z14-0. We have adopted
a single Sérsic profile for the z ≈ 14 galaxies and for the foreground
sources within 5 arcsec from the targets. ForcePho fits these profiles

simultaneously and with full posterior sampling, allowing us to meas-
ure the uncertainties in the profile and the covariance of the fluxes

between sources that seem blended, such as JADES-GS-z14-0 and its
low-redshift neighbour.
Data, residuals and the model are shown in Extended Data Fig. 11. A
single component is sufficient to match the data of both JADES-GS-z14-0
and JADES-GS-z14-1. In both cases, the surface brightness profile is
consistent with an Sérsic profile with an index of around one. For the
brightest of the two galaxies, we have determined a deconvolved
half-light radius of 260 pc, whereas the compact size of JADES-GS-z14-1
has returned just an upper limit of 160 pc.
Dust enrichment
Following ref. 34 and assuming the prescription of ref. 81 for the dust
attenuation law, AV could be used as a proxy for the dust mass:
Md ≈ 2.2 × 10 ( A r /100 pc) M⊙
4
V d
2 , where rd is the radius over which the
interstellar medium dust is assumed to extend. However, we stress
that the AV parameter is not an accurate measure of the actual amount
of dust as this parameter is simply estimated from the spectral fitting
assuming an dust attenuation law. Assuming that the spatial extension
of the dust is as large as the size of the galaxy (that is, rd = rUV), we derived
a dust mass Md =5×10 M⊙

4 and Md < 0.5 × 10 M⊙

4 for the two galaxies,
respectively. Comparing these masses with the stellar masses, we find

a dust-to-stellar mass fraction of less than 10−4 for both galaxies
(Extended Data Fig. 12), which is a factor greater than ten lower than
those inferred in galaxies at z ≈ 6–7(10 –10 ) −2 −3 (refs. 37,82,83) and
that predicted by supernova models without reverse shock36,84.
Extended Data Fig. 12 shows the timescales to reach the asymptotic
dust-to-stellar mass ratio due to various dust enrichment processes
and assuming that galaxies formed at z = 20 from a single star-formation
burst (review by Schneider and Maiolino36). In the first few million
years, the dust is dominated by supernovae, and in less than 5 Myr, the
galaxy has already reached a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of around
1/1,000. Even assuming a different realistic star-formation history,
the dust-to-stellar mass reaches the asymptotic values of less than

10 Myr. Reverse shocks created by the interaction between the expand-
ing supernova blast wave and the interstellar medium can limit the

effective dust enrichment by supernovae85–88, as indicated by the
orange shaded region in Extended Data Fig. 12. However, the efficiency
of dust destruction due to reverse shocks is still debated, and
different models predict different survival rates36.

0.01 and 0.1. For reference, the blue line marked 2k, where k is the number of
emission lines falling within the search window, reports the mean value of the
χ 2
statistic under the null hypothesis of no emission lines. There is a peak at
z = 14.063 with a p-value of 0.01249. b, Potential line flux signal-to-noise ratios
and the overlay shows the locations of the emission lines searched for at the
peak of the combined p-value. There are no emission lines with a level of
significance higher than 3σ.

a, Posterior probability distributions obtained with Beagle for our fiducial fits,
along with the observed spectrum and model prediction, for JADES-GS-z14-0.
From left to right, the columns show the stellar mass M*

. The 1D (marginal) posterior distribution of each parameter is
plotted along the diagonal, where the shaded gray regions represent the
1σ credible interval. The off-diagonal panels show the 2D ( joint) posterior

distributions, with the shaded blue regions representing the 1, 2, and 3σ credible
intervals. b, The observed spectrum (red line), model predictions (dark blue line),
and model predictions before applying instrumental effects (i.e. line-spread
function and calibration polynomial, grey line). The model predictions at
λ < 1450 Å are shown with a cyan line, to indicate that this region was masked
during the fitting. In the central panel of the inset, we show the residuals in
units of observed errors and the ±1σ region in grey, while the bottom panel
indicates the calibration polynomial.

and fluxes with the recovered galaxy component for JADES-GS-z14-0 (a) and
JADES-GS-z14-1 (b) in the multiple NIRCam bands. Each frame shows a 2′′ × 2′′

stamp centred on the location of each galaxy. The figure shows that the model
has fit the data well within all bands without leaving significant residuals.

Extended Data Fig. 12 | Dust to stellar mass ratio. Dust enrichment models by
supernovae (SNe) with no (blue) and with (orange) the effect of the partial dust
destruction due to the reverse shock, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars
from a single star-formation burst at z = 20. The relative contribution of the SNe
and AGB dust formation are estimated assuming an initial progenitor metallicity
in the range 0.01 < / Z Z⊙ < 0.146. Black circles illustrate the dust-to-stellar mass

ratio of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1. A proxy of the dust masses of the
two z ~ 14 galaxies has been estimated from the AV parameter, assuming that
dust is distributed in a sphere with a radius as large as the galaxy radius34.
We also report in red squares the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of HST-selected,
UV-bright galaxies at z ~ 6–7, with dust measurements from ground-based
millimeter telescopes37,59,83.
