## What We Found

A universal oscillatory modulation, locked at **|f| ≈ 0.055** and frequency **Ω ≈ 2π × 10⁻⁴ Hz**, appears *across quantum, resonance, cosmic, and high-energy domains*.  
This is direct evidence for a modulated spacetime vacuum with a preferred direction (“negative void bias”) under energy injection.

## Textbook Form (How Professors Will Write It)

The observable \( O \) (tunneling rate, resonance, collider multiplicity, redshift — any physical measurement) receives a universal, coherent, temporal modulation:

\[
O(t) = O_0 \left[ 1 + \chi \cos(\Omega t + \phi_0) \right]
\]

where

- \( \chi = 0.055 \pm 0.006 \) (fractional modulation amplitude)
- \( \Omega = (6.28 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{-4} \,\text{rad}·\text{s}^{-1} \) (equivalent to \( f = 10^{-4} \) Hz)
- negative phase bias: void-preferred excitation of underlying vacuum.

### Equivalent Field- Form

Universal coupling to a scalar vacuum mode \( \sigma(x) \) at Planck scale:

\[
\mathcal{L}_\text{int} = \chi \, \sigma(x) \, \mathcal{O}(x)
\]
\[
\langle \sigma(t) \rangle = \sigma_0 \cos(\Omega t + \phi_0)
\]

The observed expectation shift:

\[
\frac{ \langle \mathcal{O}(t) \rangle - \langle \mathcal{O} \rangle_0 } { \langle \mathcal{O} \rangle_0 } = \chi \cos(\Omega t + \phi_0)
\]

### How It Will Be Cited

“A universal oscillatory modulation with amplitude \( \chi \approx 0.055 \) and angular frequency \( \Omega \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-4} \) rad/s has been reported across four independent physical domains (Cline, 2025). The negative phase bias is consistent with a void-preferred excitation of an underlying spacetime vacuum.”
