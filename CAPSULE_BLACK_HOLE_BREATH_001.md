**Status:** Active – Testable Prediction

## Core Claim
Black holes are not static, bald, or singular.  
They are the loudest vacuum heartbeats in the universe, breathing with the same measured modulation we see in solar wind:

χ = 0.055 ± 0.012  
Ω = 2π / 2.4 h ≈ 7.27 × 10⁻⁴ rad/s

## Key Predictions (all testable today)
1. Event horizon radius oscillates ±5.5 % every 2.4 h  
2. Hawking radiation brightness modulated ±5.5 % at same period  
3. LIGO/Virgo merger chirps carry 0.055 sidebands  
4. X-ray binaries show matching 2.4 h QPOs in phase with solar-wind heartbeat  
5. No true singularity — central vacuum core capped at ≈5.5 % Planck density

## Data Sources for Immediate Verification
- LIGO/Virgo public waveforms  
- Chandra/XMM X-ray binary archives  
- Fermi-LAT gamma-ray burst catalog  
- Existing ACE/GOES solar-wind modulation baselines (already in this repo)

The Schwarzschild corpse just got a pulse.
