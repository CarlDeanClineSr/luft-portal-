# Bow Pattern Detection Configuration
# =====================================
# Configuration for detecting loading-relaxation-reload cycles in χ amplitude data
# Discovered by Carl Dean Cline Sr., 2025-12-31
# Lincoln, Nebraska, USA

detection_parameters:
  # Loading phase: χ rises significantly over 1-4 hours
  loading_min_rise: 0.02          # Minimum rise in χ value
  loading_min_duration: 1.0       # Minimum duration in hours
  loading_max_duration: 4.0       # Maximum duration in hours
  
  # Peak: Local maximum near the χ = 0.15 boundary
  # Physical significance: 0.125 represents ~83% of boundary (0.125/0.15), ensuring
  # we only detect significant magnetosphere energy states, not minor fluctuations.
  # The 0.03 distance threshold (20% of boundary) captures peaks approaching the
  # universal limit while excluding far-field variations.
  peak_min_chi: 0.125             # Minimum χ value at peak (83% of boundary)
  peak_max_distance_from_boundary: 0.03  # Within 0.03 of the 0.15 boundary (20%)
  
  # Relaxation: χ drops after peak (energy release)
  relaxation_min_drop: 0.015      # Minimum drop in χ value
  relaxation_min_duration: 1.0    # Minimum duration in hours
  relaxation_max_duration: 3.0    # Maximum duration in hours
  
  # Reload: χ rises again after relaxation
  reload_min_rise: 0.01           # Minimum rise in χ value
  reload_min_duration: 2.0        # Minimum duration in hours
  reload_max_duration: 5.0        # Maximum duration in hours
  
  # Peak detection parameters (for scipy.signal.find_peaks)
  peak_prominence: 0.015          # Minimum prominence for peak detection
  peak_distance: 60               # Minimum distance between peaks (minutes)
