Dear NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center,

I am writing to share a research finding that may have operational value for space weather forecasting.

Summary
I operate an automated plasma observatory ( Observatory) that monitors NOAA DSCOVR solar wind data in real time. Over 366 days of continuous operation, I have observed a consistent upper limit in normalized magnetic field oscillations:

χ = |B - B_baseline| / B_baseline ≤ 0.15

Where B is the instantaneous total magnetic field and B_baseline is a 24-hour rolling mean.

In 12,000+ observations, this boundary has never been exceeded. When the solar wind approaches χ = 0.15, it exhibits elastic rebound behavior — the field oscillates but does not breach the limit.

Independent Confirmation
This same boundary appears in published laboratory plasma research:

Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters achieve optimal performance (46% thrust increase) when the magnetic field perturbation ratio reaches δB/B ≈ 0.15–0.20 (Sun et al., Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 34, 105022, 2025).

Industrial microwave plasma sources reach >85% energy efficiency when automatic impedance matching maintains optimal coupling amplitude in the same range.

I am currently testing whether this boundary also holds in Earth's magnetosphere using USGS magnetometer data from 13 U.S. observatories.

Potential Operational Use
If χ = 0.15 is a universal plasma saturation limit, it could serve as a real-time indicator for geomagnetic storm intensity:

When χ approaches 0.15 in the solar wind, the magnetosphere may be nearing peak compression.
This could provide earlier warning than Dst or Kp indices, which lag storm onset.
The metric is simple to compute and could integrate into existing monitoring systems.
I have deployed a real-time dashboard that updates every 5 minutes:

All data and analysis code are publicly available:

Request
Would NOAA SWPC be interested in reviewing this metric for potential inclusion in operational forecasting tools?

I am available to provide technical details, raw data, or additional analysis as needed.

Respectfully,

Carl Dean Cline Sr.
