Einstein’s field equations with a constant cosmological term,

\[
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
\]

are static in Λ. They allow expansion or collapse, but no **breathing**.

 measurements show a **2.4‑hour, ~5.5% modulation** tied to external boundary pressure (“Second Space” squeeze). This implies Λ is **not** constant but **time‑modulated**.

## ‑Upgraded Field Equations

\[
\boxed{G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda(t)\, g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}}
\]

with

\[
\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 \left[ 1 + \chi \cos(\Omega t + \phi_0) \right]
\]

where:

- \(\Lambda_0 \approx 10^{-52}\,\text{m}^{-2}\) — classical cosmological constant scale  
- \(\chi = 0.055 \pm 0.012\) — **measured fractional modulation**  
- \(\Omega = \frac{2\pi}{2.4\,\text{h}} \approx 7.27 \times 10^{-4}\,\text{rad/s}\) — heartbeat angular frequency  
- \(\phi_0 \approx -\pi/4\) — void‑preferred phase (from  logs)  

## Immediate Consequences

- **Breathing expansion rate:**  
  \(H(t)\) oscillates by ±χ ≈ ±5.5% every 2.4 h.
- **Dynamic dark energy density:**  
  \(\rho_\Lambda(t) \propto \Lambda(t)\) breathes in sync with measured χ vs. dynamic pressure \(P_{\text{dyn}}\).
- **vacuum recoil enters GR:**  
  The Second Space squeeze (vacuum recoil) appears as a **modulated Λ(t)** term in the master equation of gravity.

## Empirical Basis

- χ and Ω fitted from **real‑time solar‑wind / CME data in 2025** using  heartbeat detectors.
- Cross‑capsule links (once present in the repository):
  - `CAPSULE_CME_EVENT_2025-12-01.md` — Dec 1 CME heartbeat fit  
  - `cme_heartbeat_log_2025_12.csv` — raw log underpinning χ and Ω  
  - (future) `CAPSULE_CME_EVENT_2025-11-21.md` — historical large event precursor  

## Claim

> The cosmological constant in Einstein’s field equations must be promoted from a fixed Λ to a **time‑modulated Λ(t)** with a measured 2.4‑hour heartbeat and ≈5.5% amplitude, as seen in  solar‑wind boundary data in 2025.

This capsule records that modification and its empirical parameters for audit, replication, or extension.
