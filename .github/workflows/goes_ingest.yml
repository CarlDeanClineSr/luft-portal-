name: GOES Capsule Generation (DEPRECATED - See goes_data_audit.yml)

# This workflow has been deprecated in favor of the robust goes_data_audit.yml workflow.
# The goes_data_audit.yml workflow now handles:
# 1. Creating data/goes directory
# 2. Downloading GOES X-ray and proton flux JSON files with retry logic
# 3. Validating JSON integrity with jq
# 4. Pushing to feature branch for PR review
# 5. Clear error logging
#
# This file is kept for backward compatibility reference only.
# To enable capsule generation in the future, uncomment the schedule trigger below
# and update this workflow to use the validated data from goes_data_audit.yml as input.

on:
  # Disabled - uncomment to re-enable scheduled runs
  # schedule:
  #   - cron: "7 * * * *"  # Every hour at HH:07
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only for testing/migration
