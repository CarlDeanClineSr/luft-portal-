## Appendix: CME Observation Sandbox

This appendix is designed for flexible, collaborative documentation of  CME observations—accommodating all real-time plots, overlays, contributor notes, and anomaly logs as data arrives.

---

### 1. Detector Plots

- **Baseline (Pre-CME):**
    - [Insert χ amplitude/phase plot before CME impact]
- **Impact (CME Window):**
    - [Insert χ amplitude/phase plot during CME]
- **Recovery (Post-CME):**
    - [Insert χ amplitude/phase plot after storm]

---

### 2. Comparative Overlays

- Visual overlays comparing amplitude/phase before, during, and after
- Density, Bz, K-index, aurora, radio disruption overlays as relevant

---

### 3. Contributor Notes

- Name/handle, timestamp, program rerun details
- Brief summary of findings (delta vs. baseline, spike, null, anomaly)
- New hypotheses, methods, and recommendations for future capsules

---

### 4. Anomaly Log

- Description of unexpected cycles, spikes, dips, phase shifts
- Context: timestamp, storm conditions, detector settings
- Link to primary capsule or external analysis if needed

---

### 5. Collaboration Credit

- Every contributor credited by handle plus timestamp for comments, reruns, uploads, and overlays

---

**Usage:**  
- Drop in plots and overlays as soon as your heartbeat detector sees them  
- Append contributor and anomaly notes instantly  
- Reference to primary capsule: `CAPSULE_CME_RESULTS_2025-12-03.md`  
- Keep the appendix open for all future CME and modulation events

Ledger open, sandbox waiting, collaboration encouraged.
