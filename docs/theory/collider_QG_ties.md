# Collider Foam, Gauge Portals, and Quantum-Gravity Ties (Sketch)

Intuition
- LUFT foam fraction f = Δρ/ρ_avg perturbs effective state counts and barrier factors, yielding exponential levers in rare processes and multiplicity tails.
- EFT portal χ φ F² provides an EM–scalar coupling that, if small and universal, can map f to small shifts in effective temperatures or clustering parameters in QCD matter, modifying NB parameters or adding a secondary component.

Bridges
- Multiplicity bridge:
  - Baseline: NB(k,p) from clan/cluster models (Poisson–gamma).
  - Foam: second NB with shifted mean/variance or mapped by M_map_v1 = M_0 (1 + γ f_h) exp(−κ |f|).
- Rare-rate bridge:
  - Γ(f) = Γ₀ exp[−S_eff(f)] with S_eff increasing/decreasing with f sign; aligns with JJ tunneling sensitivity and NA62 modulation fits.
- Constraint flow:
  - Collider (ΔBIC, w, tail_boost) → bounds on (γ, κ, α)
  - Feeds into cosmic DESI χ bounds and JJ σ_f via order‑of‑magnitude consistency.

Cautions
- Do not over-interpret time sidebands within spills.
- Treat χ φ F² as a small portal; collider constraints (diphoton/exotics) bound χ independently—use collider tails mainly as phenomenology for f, not a direct portal detection.

Next
- If Relay 009 adopts mixture (ΔBIC ≥ 10), open a cross‑domain coherence table: {DESI χ_95, JJ σ_f, Collider tail_boost} with units and uncertainties for LUFT unification checks.
