# Five-field Ledger Template (copy/paste for each run)

Who and when:
- [Your Name], [Timestamp, e.g., 2025-09-02 03:15 UTC]

Setup:
- Source: [e.g., phone speaker]
- Mic/Sensor: [e.g., laptop mic]
- Room: [e.g., quiet living room]
- Notes on hardware (foam isolation, mount, battery vs AC)

Measured:
- Drift over 60 s: [e.g., +0.020 Hz], Units: Hz
- Any timing notes: [e.g., steady after 15 s]

Checks:
- Noise floor and stability: [e.g., <0.010 Hz; last 30 s steady]
- Anomalies: [e.g., bump at 22 s]

Notes:
- New thing learned: [e.g., warming increased drift]
- Next test: [e.g., humidity change]
- Attachment: [plot filename]

Foam Audit (optional — LUFT fields)
- delta_rho_over_rho_avg: [e.g., 1e-3]
- chi_mod: [e.g., 0.01]
- omega_used: [e.g., 2*pi*1e-4 Hz]
