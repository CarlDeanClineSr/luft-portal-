# Placeholder Image: IEC Electrostatic Potential Profile

**Title**: Space-Charge Perturbation in IEC Device

**Description**: This image should show a cross-sectional diagram of an IEC fusion device with electrostatic potential wells.

**Key Features**:
- Spherical cathode grid (negatively charged, -80 to -120 kV)
- Anode chamber (grounded)
- Radial potential profile Φ(r)
- Ion trajectories converging to center
- Space-charge perturbation δn/n₀
- χ_IEC ≈ 0.15 threshold for beam defocusing

**Illustrates**: Electrostatic regime (Section 3), force balance between confinement and space-charge repulsion

**Status**: PLACEHOLDER - Replace with actual diagram for publication

**Technical Details**: Shows F_confine = e·dΦ/dr vs F_repulsion = e²n·r/(2ε₀)
