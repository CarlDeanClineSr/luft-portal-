# Placeholder Image: IEC Device Schematic

**Title**: Multi-Grid IEC Fusion Device Configuration

**Description**: This image should show an engineering schematic of a practical IEC fusion device with multiple cathode grids.

**Key Features**:
- Multiple nested spherical cathode grids
- Ion source and injection system
- Beam trajectories from periphery to core
- Neutron detector (for D-D fusion measurement)
- Plasma diagnostics (density probes, potential sensors)
- Design rule callout: "Maintain δn/n₀ ≤ 0.15"

**Illustrates**: IEC prediction details (Section 9), practical device design for χ_IEC optimization

**Status**: PLACEHOLDER - Replace with actual schematic for publication
