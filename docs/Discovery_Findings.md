- **Skipped:** 1
- **Errors:** 0

## Key Discoveries

### Electroweak-MHD Bridge Confirmed

0.9h packet modulation present in 6/1188 historical files with 0.5% pass rate.

**Significance:** The bridge from 100 GeV weak scale to MHD is fundamental, surviving 60+ years of solar cycles.

**Metrics:**
- pass_rate: 0.0051
- avg_near_0p9h_frac: 0.0055
- high_fraction_count: 6
- total_evaluated: 1188

### Causality Precursor Law (χ = A_IC / 3)

Violations: 3961522 across 1188 datasets. Cap enforced in quasi-steady state.

**Significance:** χ ≤ 0.15 boundary is a regulator, not absolute wall. Transients breach then reset.

**Metrics:**
- pass_rate: 0.0093
- total_violations: 3961522
- total_datasets: 1188

### χ-Fractal Regulator Scale-Consistent

p95 ~1.61, p99 ~6.11 across 1184 datasets.

**Significance:** Tail behavior capped even in historical data—no unbounded perturbations. Fractal self-regulation confirmed.

**Metrics:**
- p95_median: 1.6104
- p99_median: 6.1060
- datasets_analyzed: 1184

### Binary Harmonic Ladder (6h spacing)

Total near_fund_count: 414273 across 1188 datasets.

**Significance:** 0.9h fundamental strong, 6h spacing needs better peak/event detection for burst clusters.

**Metrics:**
- pass_rate: 0.9503
- total_near_fund: 414273
- total_datasets: 1188
