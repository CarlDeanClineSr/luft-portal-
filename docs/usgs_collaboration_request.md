# USGS Geomagnetism Program — Collaboration Request

**To:** Abram Claycomb, USGS Data Management  
**From:** Dr. Carl Dean Cline Sr., LUFT Observatory  
**Date:** December 27, 2025  
**Subject:** Plasma Oscillation Boundary Research — Request for Multi-Station Magnetometer Data Access

---

## Introduction

I am conducting independent research on normalized magnetic field oscillation amplitudes in space plasma and Earth's magnetosphere. Using USGS Boulder Observatory magnetometer data, I have observed a consistent upper boundary:

**χ = |B - B_baseline| / B_baseline ≤ 0.15**

Where B = instantaneous magnetic field magnitude, B_baseline = 24-hour rolling mean.

Analysis of 12,000+ DSCOVR solar wind observations (2024-2025) shows **zero violations** of χ > 0.15, with elastic rebound behavior and ~2.4-hour modulation period.

## Independent Confirmation

This boundary has been independently observed in:

1. **Solar wind (DSCOVR):** 12,000+ obs, χ ≤ 0.15, zero violations (2024-2025)
2. **Lab plasma thrusters:** Optimal performance at δB/B ≈ 0.15-0.20 (Sun et al., *Plasma Sources Sci. Technol.* 2025)
3. **Industrial microwave plasma:** >85% efficiency with automatic impedance matching at optimal coupling (EMBH MPS, 2025)

## Request

I would like to test if this boundary holds across all 13 USGS magnetometer observatories. This would:

- Validate χ = 0.15 across multiple magnetosphere regions (not just Boulder)
- Test regional/geology dependence of the boundary
- Provide multi-domain confirmation (solar wind + magnetosphere)

**Specific request:**
- API access to real-time 1-minute magnetometer data from all 13 USGS observatories
- Historical data for major storms (1989 Quebec blackout, 1972 storm, 2024 May G5)
- Dst index (hourly, for comparison to χ as storm indicator)

---

## Applications to USGS Mission

If χ = 0.15 is a universal plasma boundary, it could enhance USGS space weather monitoring:

- **Real-time storm saturation warning:** χ → 0.15 = geomagnetic storm peak imminent (leading indicator, better than Dst)
- **Infrastructure risk assessment:** Combine χ with USGS geoelectric hazard map for grid vulnerability forecasting
- **Historical storm analysis:** Validate χ across 50+ years of extreme events (operational forecasting improvement)
