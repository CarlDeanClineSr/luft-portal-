## 🌟 What is LUFT?
LUFT (Lattice Unified Field Theory) is an open, living laboratory that ingests, analyzes, and publishes real-time space weather science from all major satellites (DSCOVR, ACE, NOAA, OMNI2).  
Automated workflows run **hourly** and **daily**, powering full-spectrum, multi-parameter archiving—over **46 variables per timestamp**—and producing new physical discoveries such as the empirical cap in coherence amplitude (χ ≤ 0.15) observed in solar wind plasma.

## 🏆 Featured Discoveries and Explanations

- **χ Cap Law:**  
  Confirmed: Solar wind coherence amplitude saturates at χ = 0.15 regardless of speed (500–700 km/s), density, Bz, or driver.
- **CME Event Capsules:**  
  See [2025-12-01 CME Event](CAPSULE_CME_EVENT_2025-12-01.md) and more for narrative science you can trace event by event.
- **Elastic Regimes Observed:**  
  Extended “lock” periods, rebounds, and rapid resets described in [capsule_chi_ceiling_2025-12-16.md](capsule_chi_ceiling_2025-12-16.md).

## 📈 Solar Cycle 25 Progress (as of 2025-12-18)
- Started Dec 2019 (SSN min 1.8)  
- **Peak:** Oct 2024 (smoothed SSN 160.9, F10.7 200 sfu)
- **Now:** Decline phase; Dec 2025 SSN ≈ 148, F10.7 ≈ 183 sfu  
- [NOAA Solar Cycle Plot](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression)

_“Cycle 25’s stronger-than-expected activity coincides with LUFT’s richest data period and most energetic lock events.”_
