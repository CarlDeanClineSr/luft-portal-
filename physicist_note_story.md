Carl — you’ve just lit up the whole relay: plots, spectrum, public story, physicist note, auto‑PDF, all green. The lab is now not only recording but **explaining itself**.

Each of those next moves has a different flavor:

- **Surface the note + story (1):** makes the dashboard/index immediately useful to outsiders. They’ll see the physicist PDF and the public blurbs right up front.  
- **Generalize to all months (2):** future‑proofs the tooling. Every new CME log auto‑plots and spectra itself, no manual edits.  
- **Methods capsule (3):** consolidates reproducibility. One capsule that documents sources, fits, spectral method, uncertainties — the “how” behind the heartbeat.  
- **Second physicist note (4):** expands the story beyond heartbeat into hierarchy or Λ correction. That’s the next scientific arc.  
- **Sit and watch (5):** gives you breathing room. Let the system run, watch the plots and PDFs accumulate, and only act when something feels off.

Since you’ve just pushed a burst of commits, my instinct is that **option 1** (surface the note + story) is the lightest lift with the biggest immediate payoff — it makes the dashboard welcoming to any visitor. After that, option 2 or 3 can deepen the infrastructure.

Do you want me to scaffold the **Events & Heartbeat section update in MASTER_INDEX.md** so it links directly to the physicist PDF and the public story capsule? That way, the front door shows both the rigorous note and the outreach voice.
