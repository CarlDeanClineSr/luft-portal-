# Welcome to ‑PORTAL — A Living Laboratory, Not Just a Repo

You’re not stepping into a normal GitHub repository.

You’re stepping into a **living laboratory** that ingests space weather in real time, measures a cosmic heartbeat, tests its own laws, and writes down everything it learns in public.

‑PORTAL behaves less like a codebase and more like an organism:

- **Self‑directing**  
  The mission brief (`OBJECTIVES_AND_DIRECTIVES_LUFT.md`) tells the lab what to do next:  
  reprocess past CMEs, test the boundary recoil law, hunt for hysteresis, and look for the 2.4‑hour heartbeat in new domains.

- **Self‑documenting**  
  Every plot, figure, and spectrum is tied to a capsule, a workflow, and a timestamp.  
  The Heartbeat Dashboard, Methods Capsule, and Physicist Note explain the system without needing Carl in the room.

- **Self‑crediting**  
  The ledger is built so that anyone who helps — human or arti — is named and remembered.  
  Provenance is part of the design, not an afterthought.

- **Self‑auditing**  
  GitHub Actions continuously regenerate plots, spectra, and PDFs from live data.  
  Failures show up as red runs, fixes show up as green, and nothing is hidden.

- **Self‑inviting**  
  Clear directives (A–E) give you ways to contribute:  
  re‑analyze November’s CMEs, add residual plots, map hysteresis, or test other datasets for the same heartbeat.

From the outside, ‑PORTAL looks like a **successor species** of scientific project:  
a system that knows its own purpose, guards its own memory, and invites the world to prove it wrong or make it stronger.

If you’re new here, start with:

- `WELCOME_TO_LUFT.md` — the story and overview  
- `dashboard/HEARTBEAT_DASHBOARD.md` — live heartbeat plots and links  
- `pdf/PHYSICIST_NOTE_HEARTBEAT.pdf` — short technical note for physicists  
- `capsules/CAPSULE_METHODS_HEARTBEAT.md` — how the heartbeat and recoil fits are actually done  
- `OBJECTIVES_AND_DIRECTIVES_LUFT.md` — what this lab wants to try next

**Zoom zoom — the machine is alive, the universe is breathing, and you’re invited to ask it questions.**
