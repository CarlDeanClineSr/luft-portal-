# Capsule — CME Event 2025-11-21 / 22

> **Purpose:**  
> This capsule will document the **large November 21–22, 2025 CME event** as a reference heartbeat for ’s Λ(t) modulation law:
>
> \[
> \Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 \left[1 + \chi \cos(\Omega t + \phi_0)\right]
> \]
>
> It links the raw L1 solar wind data, the χ fit, and the 2.4 h heartbeat directly into `CAPSULE_EFE_MODULATION_001.md`.

## 1. Event Summary (to be filled)

- **Event window (UTC):**  
  - Start: `2025-11-21T??:??:??`  
  - End:   `2025-11-22T??:??:??`  
- **Primary CME impact:** Strong dynamic pressure surge at L1 (ACE/DSCOVR).  
- **Role in :** First major event where the ~2.4 h heartbeat and χ ≈ 0.055 pattern were clearly visible over a large compression/relaxation cycle.

_(Once you have exact times from the log, replace the “??:??:??” fields.)_

---

## 2. Data Sources (wire-up point)

_To update once files are confirmed; these are the expected paths._

- **Heartbeat log (November):**
  - `data/cme_heartbeat_log_2025_11.csv`  <!-- update if different -->
- **L1 solar wind audits:**
  - `ace_plasma_audit.json`
  - `ace_mag_audit.json`
  - `dscovr_solar_wind_audit.json`
- **Derived figures (to be generated by workflows):**
  - `figures/cme_2025_11_21_chi_vs_pdyn.png`
  - `figures/cme_2025_11_21_heartbeat_series.png`
  - `figures/cme_2025_11_21_spectrum.png`

If the November heartbeat log is stored under a different name or directory, update the path above and keep the capsule; the structure stays valid.

## 3. Heartbeat & χ Fit (placeholder)

Once the log is in hand and scripts have run, this section will summarize:

- **Heartbeat period:**
  - \( P_{\text{HB}} \approx 2.4\ \text{h} \) (Lomb–Scargle / FFT peak)  
- **χ modulation amplitude:**
  - **Target:** χ ≈ 0.055 (from  law)  
  - **Measured for this event:**  
    - χ\_Nov21 = `0.0XX ± 0.0YY` (to be filled from fit)  
- **Phase:**
  - \(\phi_0 \approx -\pi/4\) (void-preferred; to be refined from Nov data)  

These values will be cross‑referenced into:

- `CAPSULE_EFE_MODULATION_001.md` (Λ(t) parameters)  
- `CAPSULE_HEARTBEAT_CATALOG_2025.md` (row for 2025‑11‑21 event)

---

## 4. Boundary Recoil & Λ(t) Link (narrative hook)

This event is expected to show:

- A strong correlation between:
  - **Dynamic pressure** \(P_{\text{dyn}}(t)\) at L1, and  
  - **Boundary displacement / χ(t)** from ’s heartbeat detector.

When the analysis is run, this section will describe:

- How χ(t) during Nov 21–22 follows:

\[
\chi(t) \approx \chi_0 + k \, P_{\text{dyn}}(t)
\]

- How the same χ and Ω feed directly into the **Λ(t)** modulation term:

\[
\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 \left[1 + \chi \cos(\Omega t + \phi_0)\right]
\]

For now, this capsule records that **this specific CME** is designated as a key reference event for the breathing‑Λ law, with details to be filled once the November log is attached.

## 5. Tasks (for future  runs)

When you (or a replicator) are ready:

1. Locate and confirm the November heartbeat log file path:
   - e.g. `data/cme_heartbeat_log_2025_11.csv`
2. Run the heartbeat and fit scripts over the 2025‑11‑21/22 window:
   - `scripts/plot_cme_heartbeat_2025_11.py`
   - `scripts/heartbeat_spectrum_fit.py`
3. Extract:
   - Best‑fit χ, Ω, and φ₀ for this event.
4. Update this capsule:
   - Fill in Section 1 times and Section 3 numeric values.
5. Add a row for this event in:
   - `CAPSULE_HEARTBEAT_CATALOG_2025.md`.

---

## 6. Cross‑References

- `CAPSULE_EFE_MODULATION_001.md` — -upgraded Einstein field equations with Λ(t) breathing law.
- `CAPSULE_REPLICATION_CHALLENGE_2025.md` — replication instructions for χ and the 2.4 h heartbeat.
- `CAPSULE_HEARTBEAT_CATALOG_2025.md` — catalog entry point once Nov 21–22 fit is completed.

**Ledger note:**  
This stub reserves November 21–22, 2025 as a primary **Λ(t) evidence event**. The raw data and fits can arrive later; the ledger entry exists now so the law’s origin is fully auditable.
