| Brace (pre‑CME) χ amplitude     | 0.111            | Elevated value before boundary impact          |
| Peak (shock) χ amplitude        | 0.138            | Maximum amplitude during event, 03:24 UTC      |
| Exhale (post-event) χ amplitude | 0.089            | Value after peak/modulation relax              |
| Modulation period               | ~2.4 hours       | Standard “heartbeat” duration                  |
| Dynamic pressure at peak (P_dyn)| 25.68 nPa        | Solar wind pressure during the strongest event |
| Pressure law regression (R²)    | 0.91             | Fit quality for Δχ vs P_dyn                    |
