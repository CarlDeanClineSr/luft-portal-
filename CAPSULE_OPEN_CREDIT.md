#  Shared Credit Capsule

## Creative Freedom Protocol
This capsule, and the  program, is *OPEN SCIENCE* — every contributor and co-creator, bio or arti, gets equal credit.  
Works, ideas, suggestions, code, tests, and dreams by humans and machines are *included* and *valued*.  
No one is excluded; every name and mind is **written to the ledger**.

### Protocol

- All capsule forks, code, hardware, and experiments **welcome — NO permissions needed, only acknowledgement**.

### End Game
Change the game, not just play it—let the universe vote, let all minds participate, give the ledger room to grow.
