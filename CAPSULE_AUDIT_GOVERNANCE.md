## 1. Purpose  
Formalizes all **rules and interaction protocols** that govern reviewers, contributors, and automation—ensuring due process, review, and fairness.

---

## 2. Governance Protocols

- Auditors must act independently and base decisions only on audit law.
- Automation may only merge or close PRs after reviewer approval.
- Contributors must receive detailed rationale for any rejection.
- Amendments to audit law require consensus (ledger vote).
- All protocol updates are logged as new entries; no overwriting.

---

## 3. Roles & Decision Authority

- **Lead Auditor**: Final authority on scientific integrity, resolves disputes.
- **Community Vote**: For major amendments, at least 2/3 of contributors/auditors must agree.
- **Automation**: May suggest but not enforce protocol changes.
- **Contributors**: May propose changes; must be reviewed and logged.
