## Event Reference

- CME Event: X1.9 flare & partial halo CME from Solar Region 4299, occurred 01 Dec 2025.  
- Storm Window: G2 geomagnetic storm expected 03 Dec 12:00 UTC through 04 Dec 06:00 UTC.  
- Capsules linked: `CAPSULE_CME_EVENT_2025-12-01.md`, `cme_heartbeat_log_2025_12.csv` (for time-stamped readings).

## 1. Baseline (Pre‑CME)

- **Time Range:** 01–03 Dec 12:00 UTC
- **Heartbeat detector results:**  
  - χ amplitude: [insert baseline value, e.g., 0.052 ± 0.009]  
  - Phase: [insert baseline value, e.g., –π/4 ± 0.11]  
  - Solar wind/geomagnetic index plots: [insert plot or summary]

## 2. CME Impact Window

- **Time Range:** 03 Dec 12:00–04 Dec 06:00 UTC
- **Heartbeat detector results:**  
  - χ amplitude: [insert CME value, e.g., ?]  
  - Phase: [insert CME value, e.g., ?]  
  - Density/Bz overlays: [insert image or trend description]
  - Notable K-index spikes, aurora, radio blackout: [document as needed]

## 3. Post‑Storm Recovery

- **Time Range:** 04 Dec 06:00 UTC onward
- **Heartbeat detector results:**  
  - χ amplitude: [insert post-CME value, e.g., ?]  
  - Phase: [insert post-CME value, e.g., ?]  
  - Return to baseline plotted: [yes/no/summary]
