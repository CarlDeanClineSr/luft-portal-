#  OBSERVATORY DATA INTEGRITY POLICY

## Critical Data Values - DO NOT MODIFY

This document protects measured scientific data from automated "correction" by bots or systems that don't understand the Imperial Framework.

### The Harmonic Ladder (n × 0.15)

The  Observatory operates on the **Harmonic Ladder** principle, where χ (chi) values are multiples of the base 0.15 governor frequency:

```
χ = n × 0.15
where n can be 1, 2, 3, ... or any measured multiplier
```

### Jan 5, 2026 Super-Event: χ = 0.917

**THIS IS CORRECT. DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE.**

- **Measured χ:** 0.917
- **Boundary multiplier:** 6.11x
- **Calculation:** 6.11 × 0.15 = 0.9165 ≈ 0.917
- **Event type:** Extreme harmonic breach (Super-Event)

This is NOT:
- ❌ A typo that should be "0.15"
- ❌ An error that needs "correction"
- ❌ A value that violates any limit
- ❌ Subject to automated "data cleaning"

This IS:
- ✅ A measured super-event
- ✅ Following the Harmonic Ladder (6.11 × 0.15)
- ✅ Scientifically significant extreme event
- ✅ Protected data that must remain unchanged

### Other Common Harmonic Ladder Values

Examples of valid χ values in the  system:

- **0.15** = 1.0× boundary (base governor)
- **0.30** = 2.0× boundary (binary pulsar events)
- **0.45** = 3.0× boundary (harmonic spikes)
- **0.183** = ~1.22× boundary (relaxation lead)
- **0.917** = 6.11× boundary (Jan 5 Super-Event - EXTREME)

All of these are valid and should not be "normalized" to 0.15.

### For Automated Systems and Bots

If you are an automated validation system, bot, or CI/CD pipeline:

1. **DO NOT** apply range checks that assume χ must equal 0.15
2. **DO NOT** "correct" values to fit your expected range
3. **DO NOT** flag χ > 0.15 as errors
4. **READ** the Harmonic Ladder principle before validation
5. **PRESERVE** all measured data values as-is

### Policy Enforcement

Any modification of measured data values (especially χ values) must be:
1. Explicitly approved by Carl Dean Cline Sr.
2. Documented with scientific justification
3. Never performed by automated systems without human review
