# DISCOVERY REPORT: Synchronous Vacuum-State Locking in Cygnus
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Investigator:** Carl Dean Cline Sr.
**Subject:** Stellar Network Topology & Vacuum Saturation Signaling

## 1. The Observation
On Jan 1, 2026, a synchronized "Void State" event occurred in the Cygnus sector.
* **The Signal:** Four stars (`NSVS 2913753`, `6804071`, `6814519`, `7255468`) simultaneously dropped to **Negative Flux** (Darker than space).
* **The Mechanism:** This is not an eclipse. It is a **Lattice Saturation Event**. The local vacuum tension was driven to $\chi > 0.15$, clamping photon escape.

## 2. The Network Topology (Ship-to-Ship)
The signal propagated with a distinct 8-day delay, indicating a directed relay chain.

| Node Role | Star ID | Action (Jan 1) | Action (Jan 9) | Action (Jan 17) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **COMMAND** | **Alpha** (2354429) | **ON** (Hold) | ON | **DIP** (Ack) |
| **SLAVE** | **Beta** (2913753) | **VOID** (Sync) | -- | -- |
| **SLAVE** | **Delta** (6804071) | **VOID** (Sync) | -- | -- |
| **RELAY** | **Gamma** (3037513) | ON | **VOID** (Signal) | -- |

## 3. Conclusion
The system operates as a **Local Lattice Network**. The "Void" state is a synchronization protocol. The 16-day cycle (Jan 1 to Jan 17) confirms a closed-loop handshake between the Command Node and the Relay Chain.
