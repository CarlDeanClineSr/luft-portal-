The jets can be formed using any atomic species or mixture available in a compressed-gas bottle and have the following nominal initial parameters at the railgun nozzle exit: $n_e\\approx n_i \\sim 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_e \\approx T_i \\approx 1.4$ eV, $V_{\\rm jet}\\approx 30$-100 km/s, mean charge $\\bar{Z}\\approx 1$, sonic Mach number $M_s\\equiv V_{\\rm jet}/C_s>10$, jet diameter $=5$ cm, and jet length $\\approx 20$ cm. Experiments to date have focused on the study of merging-jet dynamics and the shocks that form as a result of the interaction, in both collisional and collisionless regimes with respect to the inter-jet classical ion mean free path, and with and without an applied magnetic field. However, many other studies are also possible, as discussed in this paper.",

      "summary": "Extreme-ultraviolet pulses can propagate through ionised solid-density targets, unlike optical pulses and, thus, have the potential to probe the interior of such plasmas on sub-femtosecond timescales. We present a synthetic diagnostic method for solid-density laser-generated plasmas based on the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet attosecond probe pulse, in a pump--probe scheme. We demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of this approach through calculating the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet probe pulse propagating through a laser-generated plasma. The plasma dynamics is calculated using a particle-in-cell simulation, whereas the dispersion of the probe is calculated with an external pseudo-spectral wave solver, allowing for high accuracy when calculating the dispersion. The application of this method is illustrated on thin-film plastic and aluminium targets irradiated by a high-intensity pump pulse. By comparing the dispersion of the probe pulse at different delays relative to the pump pulse, it is possible to follow the evolution of the plasma as it disintegrates. The high-frequency end of the dispersion provides information on the line-integrated electron density, whereas lower frequencies are more affected by the highest density encountered along the path of the probe. In addition, the presence of thin-film interference could be used to study the evolution of the plasma surface.",

      "summary": "Space plasmas are known to be out of (local) thermodynamic equilibrium, as observations show direct or indirect evidences of non-thermal velocity distributions of plasma particles. Prominent are the anisotropies relative to the magnetic field, anisotropic temperatures, field-aligned beams or drifting populations, but also, the suprathermal populations enhancing the high-energy tails of the observed distributions. Drifting bi-Kappa distribution functions can provide a good representation of these features and enable for a kinetic fundamental description of the dispersion and stability of these collision-poor plasmas, where particle-particle collisions are rare but wave-particle interactions appears to play a dominant role in the dynamic. In the present paper we derive the full set of components of the dispersion tensor for magnetized plasma populations modeled by drifting bi-Kappa distributions. A new solver called DIS-K (DIspersion Solver for Kappa plasmas) is proposed to solve numerically the dispersion relations of high complexity. The solver is validated by comparing to the damped and unstable wave solutions obtained with other codes, operating in the limits of drifting Maxwellian and non-drifting Kappa models. These new theoretical tools enable more realistic characterizations, both analytical and numerical, of wave fluctuations and instabilities in complex kinetic configurations measured in-situ in space plasmas.",

The algorithm provides a low-noise description of proton and electron kinetic dynamics, by splitting in time the multi-advection Vlasov equation in phase space. Maxwell equations for the electric and magnetic fields are reorganized according to Darwin approximation to remove light waves. Several numerical tests show that ViDA successfully reproduces the propagation of linear and nonlinear waves and captures the physics of magnetic reconnection. We also discuss preliminary tests of the parallelization algorithm efficiency, performed at CINECA on the Marconi-KNL cluster. ViDA will allow to run Eulerian simulations of a non-relativistic fully-kinetic collisionless plasma and it is expected to provide relevant insights on important problems of plasma astrophysics such as, for instance, the development of the turbulent cascade at electron scales and the structure and dynamics of electron-scale magnetic reconnection, such as the electron diffusion region.",

Owing to its excellent energy-exchange mechanism, the WPI has gained increasing interest not only from theoretical points of view but also its many important applications including plasma heating and plasma acceleration. In this review work, we present theoretical backgrounds of linear and nonlinear wave-particle interactions in quantum plasmas. Specifically, we focus on the wave-particle interactions for homogeneous plasma waves (i.e., waves with infinite extent rather than a localized pulse) as well as for propagating electrostatic waves in the weak and strong quantum regimes to demonstrate the modifications of several classical features including those associated with resonant and trapped particles. Finally, the future perspectives of WPI in quantum plasmas are presented.",

      ],
      "summary": "Suprathermal electrons and inertial drifting electrons, so called electron beam, are crucial to the nonlinear dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves observed in several astrophysical plasmas. In this paper, the propagation of electron-acoustic solitary waves is investigated in a collisionless, unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background electrons, hot suprathermal electrons (modeled by a $κ$-type distribution), and stationary ions. The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A linear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude wave structures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam velocity and density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to obtain the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and investigate how their nonlinear structures depend on the kinematic and physical properties of the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by $κ$) of the hot electrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter the electron-acoustic solitary waves, but can only produce negative polarity solitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-propagates with the solitary waves, the soliton existence domain (Mach number range) becomes narrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing the beam speed and the beam-to-hot electron temperature ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool electron density ratio in high suprathermality (low $κ$). It is found that the electric potential amplitude largely declines with increasing the beam speed and the beam-to-cool electron density ratio for co-propagating solitary waves, but is slightly decreased by raising the beam-to-hot electron temperature ratio.",

      "summary": "A theoretical framework for low-frequency electromagnetic (drift-)kinetic turbulence in a collisionless, multi-species plasma is presented. The result generalises reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and kinetic RMHD (Schekochihin et al. 2009) for pressure-anisotropic plasmas, allowing for species drifts---a situation routinely encountered in the solar wind and presumably ubiquitous in hot dilute astrophysical plasmas (e.g. intracluster medium). Two main objectives are achieved. First, in a non-Maxwellian plasma, the relationships between fluctuating fields (e.g., the Alfven ratio) are order-unity modified compared to the more commonly considered Maxwellian case, and so a quantitative theory is developed to support quantitative measurements now possible in the solar wind. The main physical feature of low-frequency plasma turbulence survives the generalisation to non-Maxwellian distributions: Alfvenic and compressive fluctuations are energetically decoupled, with the latter passively advected by the former; the Alfvenic cascade is fluid, satisfying RMHD equations (with the Alfven speed modified by pressure anisotropy and species drifts), whereas the compressive cascade is kinetic and subject to collisionless damping. Secondly, the organising principle of this turbulence is elucidated in the form of a generalised kinetic free-energy invariant. It is shown that non-Maxwellian features in the distribution function reduce the rate of phase mixing and the efficacy of magnetic stresses; these changes influence the partitioning of free energy amongst the various cascade channels. As the firehose or mirror instability thresholds are approached, the dynamics of the plasma are modified so as to reduce the energetic cost of bending magnetic-field lines or of compressing/rarefying them. Finally, it is shown that this theory can be derived as a long-wavelength limit of non-Maxwellian slab gyrokinetics.",

It is shown that the derivations and some of the results obtained in these theories are internally inconsistent and contradict well-established principles of quantum and statistical mechanics, especially in their treatment of fermions and spin. Claims of large semi-classical effects of spin magnetic moments that could dominate the plasma dynamics are found to be invalid both for single-particles and collectively. Larmor moments dominate at high temperature while spin moments cancel due to Pauli blocking at low temperatures. Explicit numerical estimates from a variety of plasmas are provided to demonstrate that spin effects are indeed much smaller than many neglected classical effects. The analysis presented suggests that the aforementioned `Spin Quantum Hydrodynamic' theories are not relevant to conventional laboratory or astrophysical plasmas.",

      "summary": "We analyze the motion of the plasma critical layer by two different processes in the relativistic-electron laser-plasma interaction regime ($a_0>1$). The differences are highlighted when the critical layer ions are stationary in contrast to when they move with it. Controlling the speed of the plasma critical layer in this regime is essential for creating low-$β$ traveling acceleration structures of sufficient laser-excited potential for laser ion accelerators (LIA). In Relativistically Induced Transparency Acceleration (RITA) scheme the heavy plasma-ions are fixed and only trace-density light-ions are accelerated. The relativistic critical layer and the acceleration structure move longitudinally forward by laser inducing transparency through apparent relativistic increase in electron mass. In the Radiation Pressure Acceleration (RPA) scheme the whole plasma is longitudinally pushed forward under the action of the laser radiation pressure, possible only when plasma ions co-propagate with the laser front. In RPA the acceleration structure velocity critically depends upon plasma-ion mass in addition to the laser intensity and plasma density. In RITA, mass of the heavy immobile plasma-ions does not affect the speed of the critical layer. Inertia of the bared immobile ions in RITA excites the charge separation potential whereas RPA is not possible when ions are stationary.",

A projection method is applied to derive two scalar equations that govern the nonlinear evolution of the Alfvenic and pseudo-Alfvenic components of ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma turbulence. The mathematical form of these equations makes clear the inherently three-dimensional nature of plasma turbulence, enabling an analysis of the nonlinear properties of two-dimensional limits often used to study plasma turbulence. In the anisotropic limit k_perp >>k_parallel that naturally arises in magnetized plasma systems, the perpendicular 2D limit retains the dominant nonlinearities that are mediated only by the Alfvenic fluctuations but lacks the wave physics associated with the linear term that is necessary to capture the anisotropic cascade of turbulent energy. In the in-plane 2D limit, the nonlinear energy transfer is controlled instead by the pseudo-Alfven waves, with the Alfven waves relegated to a passive role. In the oblique 2D limit, an unavoidable azimuthal dependence connecting the wavevector components will likely cause artificial azimuthal asymmetries in the resulting turbulent dynamics. Therefore, none of these 2D limits is sufficient to capture fully the rich three-dimensional nonlinear dynamics critical to the evolution of plasma turbulence.",

Collisionless fluid models are able to resolve spatio-temporal scales that are unfeasible with fully kinetic models. However, constructing such models requires truncating the infinite hierarchy of moment equations and supplying an appropriate closure to approximate the unresolved physics. Data-driven methods have recently begun to see increased application to this end, enabling a systematic approach to constructing closures. Here, we utilise sparse regression to search for heat flux closures for one-dimensional electrostatic plasma phenomena. We examine OSIRIS particle-in-cell simulation data of Landau-damped Langmuir waves and two-stream instabilities. Sparse regression consistently identifies six terms as physically relevant, together regularly accounting for more than 95% of the variation in the heat flux. We further quantify the relative importance of these terms under various circumstances and examine their dependence on parameters such as thermal speed and growth/damping rate. The results are discussed in the context of previously known collisionless closures and linear collisionless theory.",

      "summary": "Propagation of intense laser beams is crucial for inertial confinement fusion, which requires precise beam control to achieve the compression and heating necessary to ignite the fusion reaction. The National Ignition Facility (NIF), where fusion will be attempted, is now under construction. Control of intense beam propagation may be ruined by laser beam self-focusing. We have identified the maximum laser beam power that can propagate through fusion plasma without significant self-focusing and have found excellent agreement with recent experimental data, and suggest a way to increase that maximum by appropriate choice of plasma composition with implication for NIF designs. Our theory also leads to the prediction of anti-correlation between beam spray and backscatter and suggests the indirect control of backscatter through manipulation of plasma ionization state or acoustic damping.",

As a general tendency, strong coupling effects reduce the sound velocity and facilitate the occurrence of the ion drift instability. A wide parameter range is considered from the weakly collisional to strongly collisional regimes for the ion and particle components. The chosen plasma parameters are representative to the PK-4 experiment, currently operational on board the International Space Station.",

A rarefaction wave, which is a signature component of the CD model, is generated with an initial disturbance. In the 1D gas model, the rarefaction wave propagates tailward at sound velocity and is assumed to cause thinning. Extending to a 2D gas model of a simplified plasma sheet configuration, the rarefaction wave is weakened, and the thinning ceases to propagate. Extending further to a 2D plasma model by adding magnetic field into the lobes, the rarefaction wave is quickly lost in the plasma sheet recompression, but the plasma sheet thinning is still present and propagates independently at a slower velocity than a 1D model suggests. This shows that the dynamics of plasma sheet thinning may be dominated by sheet-lobe interactions that are absent from the 1D model and may not support the behaviour assumed by the CD model.",

For this purpose, we use high-resolution numerical simulations of gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence that span the proton-electron range of scales, in a straight magnetic guide field geometry. Accounting for the averaged effect of the particles' fast gyro-motion on the slow plasma fluctuations, the GK approximation captures the dominant energy redistribution mechanisms in strongly magnetised plasma turbulence. Here, the GK system is coarse-grained with respect to a cut-off scale, separating in real space the contributions to the nonlinear interactions from the coarse-grid-scales and the sub-grid-scales (SGS). We concentrate on the analysis of nonlinear SGS effects. Not only that this allows us to investigate the flux of free energy across the scales, but also to now analyse its spatial density. We find that the net value of scale flux is an order of magnitude smaller than both the positive and negative flux density contributions. The dependence of the results on the filter type is also analysed. Moreover, we investigate the advection of energy in position space. This rather novel approach for GK turbulence can help in the development of SGS models that account for advective unstable structures for space and fusion plasmas, and with the analysis of the turbulent transport saturation.",

Both variants share a high-energy tails occurring with higher probability than the corresponding MB distribution. The high energy tail may significantly affect rate coefficients for various processes. We focus the analysis to specific situations by showing the dependence of the rate coefficients on the principal quantum number of hydrogen atoms in n-changing collisions with electrons in the excitation and ionization channels and in a temperature range relevant to the divertor region of a tokamak device. We finally discuss the implications for diagnostics of laboratory plasmas.",

The turbulent solar wind, together with sporadic solar eruptions, introduces various space plasma processes and phenomena in the solar atmosphere all the way to the Earth's ionosphere and atmosphere and outward to interact with the interstellar media to form the heliopause and termination shock. Remarkable progress has been made in space plasma physics in the last 65 years, mainly due to sophisticated in-situ measurements of plasmas, plasma waves, neutral particles, energetic particles, and dust via space-borne satellite instrumentation. Additionally high technology ground-based instrumentation has led to new and greater knowledge of solar and auroral features. As a result, a new branch of space physics, i.e., space weather, has emerged since many of the space physics processes have a direct or indirect influence on humankind. After briefly reviewing the major space physics discoveries before rockets and satellites, we aim to review all our updated understanding on coronal holes, solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which are central to space weather events at Earth, solar wind, storms and substorms, magnetotail and substorms, emphasizing the role of the magnetotail in substorm dynamics, radiation belts/energetic magnetospheric particles, structures and space weather dynamics in the ionosphere, plasma waves, instabilities, and wave-particle interactions, long-period geomagnetic pulsations, auroras, geomagnetically induced currents (GICs), planetary magnetospheres and solar/stellar wind interactions with comets, moons and asteroids, interplanetary discontinuities, shocks and waves, interplanetary dust, space dusty plasmas and solar energetic particles and shocks, including the heliospheric termination shock.

      "summary": "Magnetic fields play an important role in astrophysical accretion discs, and in the interstellar and intergalactic medium. They drive jets, suppress fragmentation in star-forming clouds and can have a significant impact on the accretion rate of stars. However, the exact amplification mechanisms of cosmic magnetic fields remain relatively poorly understood. Here I start by reviewing recent advances in the numerical and theoretical modelling of the 'turbulent dynamo', which may explain the origin of galactic and inter-galactic magnetic fields. While dynamo action was previously investigated in great detail for incompressible plasmas, I here place particular emphasis on highly compressible astrophysical plasmas, which are characterised by strong density fluctuations and shocks, such as the interstellar medium. I find that dynamo action works not only in subsonic plasmas, but also in highly supersonic, compressible plasmas, as well as for low and high magnetic Prandtl numbers. I further present new numerical simulations from which I determine the growth of the turbulent (un-ordered) magnetic field component ($B_\\mathrm{turb}$) in the presence of weak and strong guide fields ($B_0$). I vary $B_0$ over 5 orders of magnitude and find that the dependence of $B_\\mathrm{turb}$ on $B_0$ is relatively weak, and can be explained with a simple theoretical model in which the turbulence provides the energy to amplify $B_\\mathrm{turb}$. Finally, I discuss some important implications of magnetic fields for the structure of accretion discs, the launching of jets, and the star formation rate of interstellar clouds.",

The description is based on a Hermite-Laguerre decomposition of the velocity dependence of the electron distribution function. The damping rate, frequency, and eigenmode spectrum of electron-plasma waves are found as functions of the collision frequency and wavelength. A comparison is made between the collisionless Landau damping limit, the Lenard-Bernstein and Dougherty collision operators, and the electron-ion collision operator, finding large deviations in the damping rates and eigenmode spectra. A purely damped entropy mode, characteristic of a plasma where pitch-angle scattering effects are dominant with respect to collisionless effects, is shown to emerge numerically, and its dispersion relation is analytically derived. It is shown that such a mode is absent when simplified collision operators are used, and that like-particle collisions strongly influence the damping rate of the entropy mode.",

At large scales, where the turbulence is predominantly Alfvenic, measurements of critical balance, residual energy, and 3D structure are discussed, along with comparison to recent models of strong Alfvenic turbulence. At these scales, a few percent of the energy is also in compressive fluctuations, and their nature, anisotropy, and relation to the Alfvenic component is described. In the small scale kinetic range, below the ion gyroscale, the turbulence becomes predominantly kinetic Alfven in nature, and measurements of the spectra, anisotropy, and intermittency of this turbulence are discussed with respect to recent cascade models. One of the major remaining questions is how the turbulent energy is dissipated, and some recent work on this question, in addition to future space missions which will help to answer it, are briefly discussed.",

The prevalence of power-law energy distributions in space/astrophysical observations and kinetic simulations of systems with a variety of acceleration and trapping (or escape) mechanisms poses a deep mystery. We consider the possibility that such distributions can be modeled from maximum-entropy principles, when accounting for generalizations beyond the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Using a dimensional representation of entropy (related to the Renyi and Tsallis entropies), we derive generalized maximum-entropy distributions with a power-law tail determined by the characteristic energy scale at which irreversible dissipation occurs. By assuming that particles are typically energized by an amount comparable to the free energy (per particle) before equilibrating, we derive a formula for the power-law index as a function of plasma parameters for magnetic dissipation in systems with sufficiently complex topologies. The model reproduces several results from kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection.",

A parameter scan in the local values of the ion-temperature gradient and flow shear is performed. It is demonstrated that the experimentally observed state is near the stability threshold and that this stability threshold is nonlinear: sheared turbulence is subcritical, i.e. the system is formally stable to small perturbations, but, given a large enough initial perturbation, it transitions to a turbulent state. A scenario for such a transition is proposed and supported by numerical results: close to threshold, the nonlinear saturated state and the associated anomalous heat transport are dominated by long-lived coherent structures, which drift across the domain, have finite amplitudes, but are not volume filling; as the system is taken away from the threshold into the more unstable regime, the number of these structures increases until they overlap and a more conventional chaotic state emerges. Whereas this appears to represent a new scenario for transition to turbulence in tokamak plasmas, it is reminiscent of the behaviour of other subcritically turbulent systems, e.g. pipe flows and Keplerian magnetorotational accretion flows.",

To describe this phenomenon, a temporal coarse-graining formalism was developed (Barbieri et al. 2024b). In this work, we generalize that approach to cover regimes where the timescales of temperature fluctuations are comparable to or exceed the electron crossing time. We derive a set of kinetic equations that incorporate an additional term arising from the coarse-graining procedure, which was not present in the earlier formulation. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the plasma dynamics under these broader conditions, showing that the electric field influences the system when fluctuation timescales approach the electron crossing time. However, for timescales much larger than the proton crossing time, the electric field becomes negligible. The observed behaviours are interpreted within the framework of the extended temporal coarse-graining theory, and we identify the regimes and conditions in which temperature inversion persists.",

The dispersion properties of the surface waves are analyzed in some particular cases of interest and the relative influence of the quantum forces on these waves are also studied for a nano-sized GaAs semiconductor plasma.

Collisions seem necessary to generate a shock wave when two fluids collide fast enough, to fulfill the Rankine-Hugoniot relations, to establish an equation of state or a Maxwellian distribution. Yet, these seemingly collisional features are routinely either observed or assumed, in relation with collision\\emph{less} astrophysical plasmas. This article will review our current answers to the following questions: How do colliding collisionless plasmas end-up generating a shock as if they were fluids? To which extent are the Rankine-Hugoniot relations fulfilled in this case? Do collisionless shocks propagate like fluid ones? Can we use an equation of state to describe collisionless plasmas, like MHD codes for astrophysics do? Why are Maxwellian distributions ubiquitous in Particle-In-Cell simulations of collisionless shocks? Time and length scales defining the border between the collisional and the collisionless behavior will be given when relevant. In general, when the time and length scales involved in the collisionless processes responsible for the fluid-like behavior may be neglected, the system may be treated like a fluid.",

For the chosen parameters the Coulomb collisions are important with respect to the driver but are not strong enough to keep the system stable with respect to instabilities driven by the proton temperature anisotropy. In the case of the parallel temperature anisotropy the dominant oblique fire hose instability efficiently reduces the anisotropy in a quasilinear manner. In the case of the perpendicular temperature anisotropy the dominant mirror instability generates coherent compressive structures which scatter protons and reduce the temperature anisotropy. For both the cases the instabilities generate temporarily enough wave energy so that the corresponding (anomalous) transport coefficients dominate over the collisional ones and their properties are similar to those in collisionless plasmas.",

ICE comprises strongly suprathermal emission, which has spectral peaks at multiple ion cyclotron harmonic frequencies as evaluated at the outer mid-plane edge of tokamak plasmas. The measured intensity of ICE spectral peaks scaled linearly with measured fusion reactivity in JET. In other large tokamak plasmas, ICE is currently used as an indicator of fast ions physics. The excitation mechanism for ICE is the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI); in the case of JET and TFTR, the MCI is driven by a set of centrally born fusion products, lying just inside the trapped-passing boundary in velocity space, whose drift orbits make large radial excursions to the outer mid-plane edge. Diagnostic exploitation of ICE in future experiments therefore rests in part on deep understanding of the MCI, and recent advances in computational plasma physics have led to substantial recent progress, reviewed here.",

      "summary": "The turbulent amplification of cosmic magnetic fields depends upon the material properties of the host plasma. In many hot, dilute astrophysical systems, such as the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, the rarity of particle--particle collisions allows departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. These departures exert anisotropic viscous stresses on the plasma motions that inhibit their ability to stretch magnetic-field lines. We present a numerical study of the fluctuation dynamo in a weakly collisional plasma using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations endowed with a field-parallel viscous (Braginskii) stress. When the stress is limited to values consistent with a pressure anisotropy regulated by firehose and mirror instabilities, the Braginskii-MHD dynamo largely resembles its MHD counterpart. If instead the parallel viscous stress is left unabated -- a situation relevant to recent kinetic simulations of the fluctuation dynamo and to the early stages of the dynamo in a magnetized ICM -- the dynamo changes its character, amplifying the magnetic field while exhibiting many characteristics of the saturated state of the large-Prandtl-number (${\\rm Pm}\\gtrsim{1}$) MHD dynamo. We construct an analytic model for the Braginskii-MHD dynamo in this regime, which successfully matches magnetic-energy spectra. A prediction of this model, confirmed by our simulations, is that a Braginskii-MHD plasma without pressure-anisotropy limiters will not support a dynamo if the ratio of perpendicular and parallel viscosities is too small. This ratio reflects the relative allowed rates of field-line stretching and mixing, the latter of which promotes resistive dissipation of the magnetic field. In all cases that do exhibit a dynamo, the generated magnetic field is organized into folds that persist into the saturated state and bias the chaotic flow to acquire a scale-dependent spectral anisotropy.",

Here, we propose a self-consistent method to recover this field based on a multi-mode Fourier expansion of the electrostatic interaction. We show that, under suitable conditions, this approach naturally leads to the ambipolar electric field and restores charge neutrality. The method is tested in both isothermal and multi-temperature plasma configurations. This framework provides a foundation for future developments that may include collisions, ionization, and asymmetric boundary conditions to model more realistic stellar atmospheres.",

Numerical solutions of the dispersion equation are conducted to show the different effects of the suprathermal ions and electrons. We find that the suprathermal ions can enhance the instability in large wavenumbers but suppress it in small wavenumbers. Thus, the suprathermalization of ions could be one of the factors leading to a lower limit of wavenumbers for the ITG instabilities. Besides, the numerical calculations also imply that the thermal speed ratio affects the intensities of the suprathermal effects. Finally, in the presence of density inhomogeneity, the ITG instability boundary is numerically analyzed.",

An incompressible, dissipative global stability analysis is developed to include plasma-specific two-fluid effects and neutral collisions, which are inherently absent in analyses of Taylor-Couette flows (TCFs) in liquid metal experiments. It is shown that with boundary driven flows, a ion-neutral collision drag body force significantly affects the azimuthal velocity profile, thus limiting the flows to regime where the MRI is not present. Electrically driven flow (EDF) is proposed as an alternative body force flow drive in which the MRI can destabilize at more easily achievable plasma parameters.

In this tutorial paper, we describe the wave accessibility beyond usual textbooks and especially highlight the warm plasma effects. Useful numerical models and methods are provided, which can be used to obtain a quick view of the wave accessibility parameters space. The thermal effects are modeled by both multi-fluid model with isotropic pressure term and kinetic model with Maxwellian velocity distribution function. All cold plasma waves from high frequency electron cyclotron waves, intermediate frequency low hybrid waves to low frequency ion cyclotron waves, as well as kinetic ion and electron Bernstein waves, are presented. The questions that how many plasma wave modes exist and how to find the solutions are also discussed. It is interesting to find that the warm multi-fluid model, though incapable of reproducing the Bernstein modes, can provide a quick way to determine whether the thermal effects are important. To show the kinetic thermal effects, the ray tracing calculations of the mode conversion from cold plasma waves to kinetic waves are also provided, i.e., from the slow X electron cyclotron wave to electron Bernstein wave and from the ion cyclotron fast wave to ion Bernstein wave.",

The most interesting result is finding the asymptotics of the form T_e ~ t^{-(1.2 +/- 0.1)} instead of t^{-2}, which was expected for the rarefied monatomic gas during inertial expansion. As follows from our consideration, the substantially decelerated decay of the temperature can be well explained by the specific features of the equation of state for the ultracold plasmas with strong Coulomb's coupling, whereas a heat release due to inelastic processes (in particular, three-body recombination) does not play an appreciable role in the first approximation. This conclusion is confirmed both by approximate analytical estimates, based on the model of \"virialization\" of the charged-particle energies, and by the results of \"ab initio\" numerical simulation. Moreover, the simulation shows that the above-mentioned law of temperature evolution is approached very quickly--when the virial criterion is satisfied only within a factor on the order of unity.",

The Riemann curvature of the helical flow is also obtained.",

      "summary": "The propagation of arbitrary amplitude ion-acoustic (IA) solitary waves (SWs) is studied in unmagnetized, collisionless, homogeneous electron-positron-ion (e-p-i) plasmas with finite temperature degeneracy of both electrons and positrons. Starting from a set of fluid equations for classical ions and Fermi-Dirac distribution for degenerate electrons and positrons, a linear dispersion relation for IA waves is derived. It is seen that the wave dispersion is significantly modified due to the presence of positron species and the effects of finite temperature degeneracy of electrons and positrons. In the nonlinear regime, the Sagdeev's pseudopotential approach is employed to study the existence domain and the evolution of nonlinear IA-SWs in terms of the parameters that are associated with the finite temperature degeneracy, the background number densities, and the thermal energies of electrons and positrons. It is found that in contrast to classical electron-ion plasmas both the subsonic and supersonic IA-SWs can exist in a partially degenerate e-p-i plasma.",

      "summary": "This paper will discuss simulations of the full ionization process (i.e. plasma burn-through), fundamental to creating high temperature plasma. By means of an applied electric field, the gas is partially ionized by the electron avalanche process. In order for the electron temperature to increase, the remaining neutrals need to be fully ionized in the plasma burn-through phase, as radiation is the main contribution to the electron power loss. The radiated power loss can be significantly affected by impurities resulting from interaction with the plasma facing components. The DYON code is a plasma burn-through simulator developed at Joint European Torus (JET) [1] [2]. The dynamic evolution of the plasma temperature and plasma densities including impurity content is calculated in a self-consistent way, using plasma wall interaction models. The recent installation of a beryllium wall at JET enabled validation of the plasma burn-through model in the presence of new, metallic plasma facing components. The simulation results of the plasma burn-through phase show consistent good agreement against experiments at JET, and explain differences observed during plasma initiation with the old carbon plasma facing components. In the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the allowable toroidal electric field is restricted to 0.35 [V/m], which is significantly lower compared to the typical value (~ 1 [V/m]) used in the present devices. The limitation on toroidal electric field also reduces the range of other operation parameters during plasma formation in ITER. Thus, predictive simulations of plasma burn-through in ITER using validated model is of crucial importance. This paper provides an overview of the DYON code and the validation, together with new predictive simulations for ITER using the DYON code.",

This was highlighted by a multi-disciplinary session at the 2017 American Geophysical Union Meeting, 'Frontier Solar-Terrestrial Science Enabled by the Combination of Data-Driven Techniques and Physics-Based Understanding', with considerable discussion surrounding ensemble techniques. Here ensemble methods are described in detail; using a set of predictions to improve on a single-model output, for example taking a simple average of multiple models, or using more complex techniques for data assimilation. They have been used extensively in fields such as numerical weather prediction and data science, for both improving model accuracy and providing a measure of model uncertainty. Researchers in the space weather community have found them to be similarly useful, and some examples of success stories are highlighted in this commentary. Future developments are also encouraged to transition these basic research efforts to operational forecasting as well as providing prediction errors to aid end-user understanding.",

      "summary": "In the absence of efficient collisions, deviations from thermal equilibrium of plasma particle distributions are controlled by the self-generated instabilities. The whistler instability is a notorious example, usually responsible for the regulation of electron temperature anisotropy $A = T_{\\perp}/T_\\parallel>$ (with $\\perp, \\parallel$ respective to the magnetic field direction) observed in space plasmas, e.g., solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. Suprathermal electrons present in these environments change the plasma dispersion and stability properties, with expected consequences on the kinetic instabilities and the resulting fluctuations, which, in turn, scatter the electrons and reduce their anisotropy. In order to capture these mutual effects we use a quasilinear kinetic approach and PIC simulations, which provide a comprehensive characterization of the whistler instability under the influence of suprathermal electrons. Analysis is performed for a large variety of plasma conditions, ranging from low-beta plasmas encountered in outer corona or planetary magnetospheres to a high-beta solar wind characteristic to large heliospheric distances. Enhanced by the suprathermal electrons, whistler fluctuations stimulate the relaxation of temperature anisotropy, and this influence of suprathermals increases with plasma beta parameter.",

It is crucial for forecasters, users, modelers and stakeholders to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these forecasts; therefore, it is important to verify against the most reliable truth data source available. The present study contains verification results for XRFFs using GOES-15 satellite data and GMSF using planetary K-index (Kp) values from the GFZ Helmholtz Centre. To assess the value of the verification results it is helpful to compare them against a reference forecast and the frequency of occurrence during a rolling prediction period is used for this purpose. Analysis of the rolling 12-month performance over a 19-month period suggests that both the XRFF and GMSF struggle to provide a better prediction than the reference. However, a relative operating characteristic and reliability analysis of the full 19-month period reveals that although the GMSF and XRFF possess discriminatory skill, events tend to be over-forecast.",

A comprehensive space weather understanding of a planet without a global magnetosphere and a thin atmosphere is very different from our situation at Earth so there is substantial fundamental research remaining. It is expected that the development of suitable models will lead to a comprehensive operational Mars space weather alert (MSWA) system that would provide rapid dissemination of information to Earth controllers, astronauts in transit, and those in the exploration zone (EZ) on the surface by producing alerts that are delivered rapidly and are actionable. To illustrate the importance of such a system, we use a magnetohydrodynamic code to model an extreme Carrington-type coronal mass ejection (CME) event at Mars. The results show a significant induced surface field of nearly 3000 nT on the dayside that could radically affect unprotected electrical systems that would dramatically impact human survival on Mars. Other associated problems include coronal mass ejection (CME) shock-driven acceleration of solar energetic particles producing large doses of ionizing radiation at the Martian surface. In summary, along with working more closely with international partners, the next Heliophysics Decadal Survey must include a new initiative to meet expected demands for space weather forecasting in support of humans living and working on the surface of Mars. It will require significant effort to coordinate NASA and the international community contributions.",

SPACE will operate in slit mode (MEMS) at R~400 between 0.8 and 1.8micron down to AB~23, providing redshifts to an accuracy of Delta z~0.001, regardless on the presence of bright emission lines, together with the most relevant physical and evolutionary properties. The catalog of spectroscopic redshift will allow to place the ultimate constraints on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the nature of Dark Energy. By obtaining the first 3-D all-sky map of the Universe at z~2 and beyond, SPACE will trace the growth rate of cosmic structures, the large scale structure of luminous baryons and its cosmic evolution. Besides the all-sky survey, SPACE will carry out a deep extragalactic survey over an area of ~10 sq. deg., enabling a most powerful supernova search program, and a galactic plane survey in integral field mode. Approximately 30% of the time will be open. Due to its versatility, SPACE is a ``self-sufficient'' observatory which can attack and solve the most compelling questions on the nature of the Dark Energy without complementary data from the Earth or space.

The Cassini mission for example collected over 600 gigabytes of scientific data from 2004 to 2017. This represents a surge of data on the Saturn system. Machine learning can help scientists work with data on this larger scale. Unlike many applications of machine learning, a primary use in planetary space physics applications is to infer behavior about the system itself. This raises three concerns: first, the performance of the machine learning model, second, the need for interpretable applications to answer scientific questions, and third, how characteristics of spacecraft data change these applications. In comparison to these concerns, uses of black box or un-interpretable machine learning methods tend toward evaluations of performance only either ignoring the underlying physical process or, less often, providing misleading explanations for it. We build off a previous effort applying a semi-supervised physics-based classification of plasma instabilities in Saturn's magnetosphere. We then use this previous effort in comparison to other machine learning classifiers with varying data size access, and physical information access. We show that incorporating knowledge of these orbiting spacecraft data characteristics improves the performance and interpretability of machine learning methods, which is essential for deriving scientific meaning. Building on these findings, we present a framework on incorporating physics knowledge into machine learning problems targeting semi-supervised classification for space physics data in planetary environments. These findings present a path forward for incorporating physical knowledge into space physics and planetary mission data analyses for scientific discovery.",

      "summary": "We revisit the full variety of observed temporal and spatial distributions of energetic solar protons in \"gradual\" solar energetic-particle (SEP) events resulting from the spatial variations in the shock waves that accelerate them. Differences in the shock strength at the solar longitude of a spacecraft and at the footpoint of its connecting magnetic field line, nominally 55 degrees to the west, drive much of that variation. The shock wave itself, together with energetic particles trapped near it by self-amplified Alfven waves, forms an underlying autonomous structure that can drive across magnetic field lines intact, spreading proton intensities in a widening SEP longitude distribution. During the formation of this fundamental structure, historically called an \"energetic storm particle\" (ESP) event, many SEPs leak away early, amplifying waves as they flow along well-connected field lines and broaden the distribution outward; behind this structure between the shock and the Sun a \"reservoir\" of quasi-trapped SEPs forms. Very large SEP events are complicated by additional extensive wave growth that can spread an extended ESP-like trapping region. The multiplicity of shock-related processes contributing to the observed SEP profiles causes correlations of the events to be poorly represented by the peak intensities commonly used. In fact, the extensive spatial distributions of SEPs are sometimes interwoven with the structures of the shocks that have accelerated them and sometimes free. We should consider new questions: Which extremes of the shock contribute most to the SEPs profile of an event, (1) the shock at the longitude of a spacecraft, (2) the shock ~55 degrees to the west at the footpoint of the field, or (3) SEPs that have collected in the reservoir? How does the space-time distribution of SEPs correspond with the underlying space-time distribution of shock strength?",

We present some current, recent missions and proposed/upcoming mission concepts using SmallSats that enhance space weather research and provide prototyping pathways for future operational applications; how they relate to the WMO requirements; and what challenges remain to be overcome to meet the WMO goals and operational needs in the future. With additional investment from cognizant funding agencies worldwide, SmallSats -- including standalone missions and constellations -- could significantly enhance space weather research and, eventually, operations, by reducing costs and enabling new measurements not feasible from traditional, large, monolithic missions.",

The ISS was carried by the international community between NuFact05, (the 7th International Workshop on Neutrino Factories and Superbeams, Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Rome, June 21-26, 2005) and NuFact06 (Ivine, California, 24{30 August 2006). The physics case for an extensive experimental programme to understand the properties of the neutrino is presented and the role of high-precision measurements of neutrino oscillations within this programme is discussed in detail. The performance of second generation super-beam experiments, beta-beam facilities, and the Neutrino Factory are evaluated and a quantitative comparison of the discovery potential of the three classes of facility is presented. High-precision studies of the properties of the muon are complementary to the study of neutrino oscillations. The Neutrino Factory has the potential to provide extremely intense muon beams and the physics potential of such beams is discussed in the final section of the report.",

      "summary": "Space Weather is the portion of space physics that has a direct effect on humankind. Space Weather is an old branch of space physics that originates back to 1808 with the publication of a paper by the great naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (von Humboldt, 1808). Space Weather is currently experiencing explosive growth, because its effects on human technologies have become more and more diverse. Space Weather is due to the variability of solar processes that cause interplanetary, magnetospheric, ionospheric, atmospheric and ground level effects. Space Weather can at times have strong impacts on technological systems and human health. The threats and risks are not hypothetical, and in the event of extreme Space Weather events the consequences could be quite severe for humankind. The purpose of the review is to give a brief overall view of the full chain of physical processes responsible for Space Weather risks and hazards, tracing them from solar origins to effects and impacts in interplanetary space, in the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere and at the ground. The paper shows that the risks associated with Space Weather have not been constant over time; they have evolved as our society becomes more and more technologically advanced. The paper begins with a brief introduction to the Carrington event. Next, the descriptions of the strongest known Space Weather processes are reviewed. The concepts of geomagnetic storms and substorms are briefly introduced. The main effects/impacts of Space Weather are also considered, including geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) which are thought to cause power outages. The effects of radiation on avionics and human health, ionospheric effects and impacts, and thermosphere effects and satellite drag will also be discussed. Finally, we will discuss the current challenges of Space Weather forecasting and examine some of the worst-case scenarios.",

      "summary": "Like all natural hazards, space weather exhibits occasional extreme events over timescales of decades to centuries. Historical events provoked much interest but had little economic impact. However, the widespread adoption of advanced technological infrastructures over the past fifty years gives these events the potential to disrupt those infrastructures - and thus create profound economic and societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such events are rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of the events. Many other natural hazards (e.g. flash floods) are highly localised, so statistically significant datasets can be assembled by combining data from independent instances of the hazard recorded over a few decades. But we have a single instance of space weather so we would have to make observations for many centuries in order to build a statistically significant dataset. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of solar-terrestrial physics to find other ways to assess these risks. We discuss three alternative approaches: (a) use of proxy data, (b) studies of other solar systems, and (c) use of physics-based modelling. The proxy data approach is well-established as a technique for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not yet provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms. This latter risk is more suited to the other approaches. We need to develop and expand techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar systems. To make progress in modelling severe space weather, we need to focus on the physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e.g. how can dayside and tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to envelop mid-latitudes?",

      "summary": "When the first CubeSats were launched nearly two decades ago, few people believed that the miniature satellites would likely prove to be a useful scientific tool. Skeptics abounded. However, the last decade has seen the highly successful implementation of space missions that make creative and innovative use of fast-advancing CubeSat and small satellite technology to carry out important science experiments and missions. Several projects now have used CubeSats to obtain first-of-their-kind observations and findings that have formed the basis for high-profile engineering and science publications, thereby establishing without doubt the scientific value and broad utility of CubeSats. In this paper, we describe recent achievements and lessons learned from a representative selection of successful CubeSat missions with a space weather focus. We conclude that these missions were successful in part because their limited resources promoted not only mission focus but also appropriate risk-taking for comparatively high science return. Quantitative analysis of refereed publications from these CubeSat missions and several larger missions reveals that mission outcome metrics compare favorably when publication number is normalized by mission cost or if expressed as a weighted net scientific impact of all mission publications.",

These observations offer unprecedented opportunities to study solar physics and space weather, especially to diagnose the coronal magnetic fields, reveal the basic nature of solar eruptions and the related non-thermal energy release, particle accelerations and propagation, and the related emission mechanisms. These results might be the important input to the space weather modeling for predicting the occurrence of disastrous powerful space weather events. In order to provide meaningful reference for other solar physicists and space weather researchers, this paper mainly focus on discussing the potential scientific problems of solar radio spectral-imaging observations in dm-cm wavelengths and its possible applications in the field of space weather. These results will provide a helpful reference for colleagues to make full use of the latest and future observation data obtained from the above solar radio telescopes.",

      "summary": "Through the last three decades, accurate simulation of the interactions of particles with matter and modeling of detector geometries has proven to be of critical importance to the success of the international high-energy physics (HEP) experimental programs. For example, the detailed detector modeling and accurate physics of the Geant4-based simulation software of the CMS and ATLAS particle physics experiments at the European Center of Nuclear Research (CERN) Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was a determinant factor for these collaborations to deliver physics results of outstanding quality faster than any hadron collider experiment ever before.   This review article highlights the impact of detector simulation on particle physics collider experiments. It presents numerous examples of the use of simulation, from detector design and optimization, through software and computing development and testing, to cases where the use of simulation samples made a difference in the precision of the physics results and publication turnaround, from data-taking to submission. It also presents estimates of the cost and economic impact of simulation in the CMS experiment.   Future experiments will collect orders of magnitude more data with increasingly complex detectors, taxing heavily the performance of simulation and reconstruction software. Consequently, exploring solutions to speed up simulation and reconstruction software to satisfy the growing demand of computing resources in a time of flat budgets is a matter that deserves immediate attention. The article ends with a short discussion on the potential solutions that are being considered, based on leveraging core count growth in multicore machines, using new generation coprocessors, and re-engineering HEP code for concurrency and parallel computing.",

Here I highlight key open questions about the physics of space plasmas and identify the aspects of these problems that can potentially be tackled in laboratory experiments. Several past successes in laboratory space physics provide concrete examples of how complementary experiments can contribute to our understanding of physical processes at play in the solar corona, solar wind, planetary magnetospheres, and outer boundary of the heliosphere. I present developments on the horizon of laboratory space physics, identifying velocity space as a key new frontier, highlighting new and enhanced experimental facilities, and showcasing anticipated developments to produce improved diagnostics and innovative analysis methods.

      "summary": "Magnetic reconnection requires the violation of the frozen-in condition which ties gyrating charged particles to the magnetic field inhibiting diffusion. Ongoing reconnection has been identified in near-Earth space as being responsible for the excitation of substorms, magnetic storms, generation of field aligned currents and their consequences, the wealth of auroral phenomena. Its theoretical understanding is now on the verge of being completed. Reconnection takes place in thin current sheets. Analytical concepts proceeded gradually down to the microscopic scale, the scale of the electron skin depth or inertial length, recognizing that current layers that thin do preferentially undergo spontaneous reconnection. Thick current layers start reconnecting when being forced by plasma inflow to thin. For almost half a century the physical mechanism of reconnection has remained a mystery. Spacecraft in situ observations in combination with sophisticated numerical simulations in two and three dimensions recently clarified the mist, finding that reconnection produces a specific structure of the current layer inside the electron inertial (also called electron diffusion) region around the reconnection site, the X line. Onset of reconnection is attributed to pseudo-viscous contributions of the electron pressure tensor aided by electron inertia and drag, creating a complicated structured electron current sheet, electric fields, and an electron exhaust extended along the current layer. We review the general background theory and recent developments in numerical simulation on collisionless reconnection. It is impossible to cover the entire field of reconnection in a short space-limited review. The presentation necessarily remains cursory, determined by our taste, preferences, and knowledge. Only a small amount of observations is included in order to support the few selected numerical simulations.",

To follow the GRB221009A propagation through the heliosphere we used the electron and proton flux measurements from solar missions Solar Orbiter and STEREO-A; Earth magnetosphere and the solar wind missions THEMIS and Wind; meteorological satellites POES15, POES19, MetOp3; and MAVEN - a NASA mission orbiting Mars. GRB221009A had a structure of four bursts: less intense Pulse 1 - the triggering impulse - was detected by gamma-ray observatories at 131659 UT (near the Earth); the most intense Pulses 2 and 3 were detected on board all the spacecraft from the list, and Pulse 4 detected in more than 500 s after Pulse 1. Due to their different scientific objectives, the spacecraft, which data was used in this study, were separated by more than 1 AU (Solar Orbiter and MAVEN). This enabled tracking GRB221009A as it was propagating across the heliosphere. STEREO-A was the first to register Pulse 2 and 3 of the GRB, almost 100 seconds before their detection by spacecraft in the vicinity of Earth. MAVEN detected GRB221009A Pulses 2, 3, and 4 at the orbit of Mars about 237 seconds after their detection near Earth. By processing the time delays observed we show that the source location of the GRB221009A was at RA 288.5 degrees, Dec 18.5 degrees (J2000) with an error cone of 2 degrees",

      "summary": "Energetic particle instruments on board GPS satellites form a powerful global prompt proton sensor network (GPPSn) that provides an unprecedented opportunity to monitor and characterize solar energetic protons targeting the Earth. The medium-Earth-orbits of the GPS constellation have the unique advantage of allowing solar energetic protons to be simultaneously measured from multiple points in both open- and closed-field line regions. Examining two example intervals of solar proton events, we showcase in this study how GPS proton data are prepared, calibrated and utilized to reveal important features of solar protons, including their source, acceleration/scattering by interplanetary shocks, the relative position of Earth when impinged by these shocks, the shape of solar particle fronts, the access of solar protons inside the dynamic geomagnetic field, as well temporally-varying proton distributions in both energy and space. By comparing to Van Allen Probes data, GPS proton observations are further demonstrated not only to be useful for qualitatively monitoring the dynamics of solar protons, but also for quantitative scientific research including determining cutoff L-shells. Our results establish that this GPPSn can join forces with other existing solar proton monitors and contribute to observing, warning, understanding and ultimately forecasting the incoming solar energetic proton events.",

Consequently the frequency of dyonic plasma has been obtained and it is emphasized that there is a different plasma frequency for each species depending on wave number k. For k to be real, only those generalized electromagnetic waves are allowed to pass, for which the usual frequency is greater than the plasma frequency (i.e. ω>ω_{p}). It is shown that the plasma frequency sets the lower cuts for the frequencies of electromagnetic radiation that can pass through a plasma . Accordingly the ohm's law has been reestablished to derive the plasma oscillation equation as well as the magetohydrodynamic wave equation and the energy of dyons in unique and consistent manner.",

Our AI models incorporate tensor Fourier neural operators as their backbone, which we implemented with the TensorLY package. Our results indicate that physics informed neural operators can accurately capture the physics of magnetohydrodynamics simulations that describe laminar flows with Reynolds numbers $Re\\leq250$. We also explore the applicability of our AI surrogates for turbulent flows, and discuss a variety of methodologies that may be incorporated in future work to create AI models that provide a computationally efficient and high fidelity description of magnetohydrodynamics simulations for a broad range of Reynolds numbers.

A first challenge is to find an appropriate paracontrolled ansatz which must consist of both the velocity and the magnetic fields. Second challenge is that for some non-linear terms, renormalizations cannot be achieved individually; we overcome this obstacle by strategically coupling certain terms together rather than separately. Our proof is also inspired by the work of \\cite{ZZ15}.",

Building on the analogy with charged liquids at high magnetic Reynolds numbers, the persistence of anomalous currents is scrutinized for parametrically large conductivities when the plasma approximation is accurate. Different examples in globally neutral systems suggest that the magnetic configurations minimizing the energy density with the constraint that the helicity be conserved coincide, in the perfectly conducting limit, with the ones obtainable in ideal magnetohydrodynamics where the anomalous currents are neglected. It is argued that this is the rationale for the ability of extending to anomalous magnetohydrodynamics the hydromagnetic solutions characterized by finite gyrotropy. The generally covariant aspects of the problem are addressed with particular attention to conformally flat geometries which are potentially relevant for the description of the electroweak plasma prior to the phase transition.",

We show that although the electric field does not contribute in the metric and curvature of the spacetime, the magnetic field appears in the time-time component of the metric. The appearance of the magnetic field, in principle, leads to new relativistic contributions to the magnetohydrodynamic governing equations. Therefore, using the post-Newtonian metric, we find the relativistic corrections to the magnetohydrodynamic equations up to the first post-Newtonian order.

We enumerate the transport coefficients at leading order in derivatives, including electrical conductivities, viscosities, and thermodynamic coefficients. We find the constraints on transport coefficients due to the positivity of entropy production, and derive the corresponding Kubo formulas. For the neutral state in a magnetic field, small fluctuations include Alfven waves, magnetosonic waves, and the dissipative modes. For the state with a non-zero dynamical charge density in a magnetic field, plasma oscillations gap out all propagating modes, except for Alfven-like waves with a quadratic dispersion relation. We relate the transport coefficients in the \"conventional\" magnetohydrodynamics (formulated using Maxwell's equations in matter) to those in the \"dual\" version of magnetohydrodynamics (formulated using the conserved magnetic flux).",

It was argued from the point of view of fluid with higher-form symmetry that magnetohydrodynamics remains a consistent, non-dissipative theory even in the limit where temperature is negligible compared to the magnetic field. In this limit, leading-order corrections to the ideal magnetohydrodynamics arise at the second order in the gradient expansion of relevant fields, not at the first order as in the standard hydrodynamic theory of dissipative fluids and plasmas. In this paper, we classify the non-dissipative second-order transport by constructing the appropriate non-linear effective action. We find that the theory has eleven independent charge and parity invariant transport coefficients for which we derive a set of Kubo formulae. The relation between hydrodynamics with higher-form symmetry and the theory of force-free electrodynamics, which has recently been shown to correspond to the zero-temperature limit of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, as well as simple astrophysical applications are also discussed.",

It is shown that the energy-momentum tensor for the dual string can be reinterpreted as an energy-momentum tensor for magnetohydrodynamics, provided certain conditions are satisfied.

In this work, we consider bottom-up holographic models at finite magnetic field and (free) charge density in presence of dynamical boundary gauge fields which are introduced using mixed boundary conditions. We numerically study the spectrum of the lowest quasi-normal modes and successfully compare the obtained results to magnetohydrodynamics theory in $2+1$ dimensions. Surprisingly, as far as the electromagnetic coupling is small enough, we find perfect agreement even in the large magnetic field limit. Our results prove that a holographic description of magnetohydrodynamics does not necessarily need higher-form bulk fields but can be consistently derived using mixed boundary conditions for standard gauge fields.",

This is the first analysis of charged test particle evolution in resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations.

The effect of the Lundquist number, magnetization, and plasma-$β$ on the particle energy distribution is explored for a range of astrophysically relevant parameters. We find that electrons accelerate to non-thermal energies in the thin current sheets in all cases. We find two separate acceleration regimes: An exponential increase of the Lorentz factor during the island coalescence where the acceleration depends linearly on the resistivity and a nonlinear phase with high variability.

We refer to the latter as \"fracton magnetohydrodynamics\", in analogy to conventional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which governs systems with gauged charge conservation. We show that fracton MHD arises naturally from higher-rank Maxwell's equations and in systems with one-form symmetries obeying certain constraints; while we focus on \"minimal\" higher-rank generalizations of MHD that realize diffusion, our methods may also be used to identify other, more exotic hydrodynamic theories (e.g., with magnetic subdiffusion). In contrast to semi-microscopic derivations of MHD, our approach elucidates the origin of the hydrodynamic modes by identifying the corresponding higher-form symmetries. Being rooted in symmetries, the hydrodynamic modes may persist even when the semi-microscopic equations no longer provide an accurate description of the system.",

The resulting integrator preserves important quantities like the total energy, magnetic helicity and cross helicity exactly (up to machine precision). As the integrator is free of numerical resistivity, spurious reconnection along current sheets is absent in the ideal case. If effects of electron inertia are added, reconnection of magnetic field lines is allowed, although the resulting model still possesses a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure. After reviewing the conservation laws of the model equations, the adopted variational principle with the related conservation laws are described both at the continuous and discrete level. We verify the favourable properties of the variational integrator in particular with respect to the preservation of the invariants of the models under consideration and compare with results from the literature and those of a pseudo-spectral code.",

The black brane solution features a fortuitous SO(3) symmetry, providing a new symmetry principle for describing the magnetohydrodynamics. Since the bulk theory contains multiple 2-form gauge fields, the resistivity becomes matrix-valued. We find that the antisymmetric part of the resistivity matrix exhibits novel features depending on the UV cut-off of the theory. We also compute the shear and bulk viscosities and find that the bulk viscosity is proportional to the shear viscosity. Remarkably, the proportionality constant is exactly what is required for conformality, despite the zeroth-order energy-momentum tensor not being trace-free.",

We formulate the hydrodynamic theories with an unbroken or a spontaneously broken U(1) one-form symmetry. The latter of these describes a one-form superfluid, which is characterised by a vector Goldstone mode and a two-form superfluid velocity. Two special limits of this theory have been studied in detail: the string fluid limit where the U(1) one-form symmetry is partly restored, and the electric limit in which the symmetry is completely broken. The transport properties of these theories are investigated in depth by studying the constraints arising from the second law of thermodynamics and Onsager's relations at first order in derivatives. We also construct a hydrostatic effective action for the Goldstone modes in these theories and use it to characterise the space of all equilibrium configurations. To make explicit contact with hot electromagnetism, the traditional treatment of magnetohydrodynamics, where the electromagnetic photon is incorporated as dynamical degrees of freedom, is extended to include parity-violating contributions. We argue that the chemical potential and electric fields are not independently dynamical in magnetohydrodynamics, and illustrate how to eliminate these within the hydrodynamic derivative expansion using Maxwell's equations. Additionally, a new hydrodynamic theory of non-conducting, but polarised, plasmas is formulated, focusing primarily on the magnetically dominated sector. Finally, it is shown that the different limits of one-form superfluids formulated in terms of generalised global symmetries are exactly equivalent to magnetohydrodynamics and the hydrodynamics of non-conducting plasmas at the non-linear level.",

HMHD supports faster magnetic reconnection and shows richer complexity in magnetic field line evolution compared to the MHD. The magnetic reconnections triggering the flare are explored by numerical simulations augmented with relevant multi-wavelength observations. The initial coronal magnetic field is constructed by non-force-free extrapolation of photospheric vector magnetic field. Magnetic structure involved in the flare is identified to be a flux rope, with its overlying magnetic field lines constituting the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) along with a three-dimensional null point and a null line. Compared to the MHD simulation, the HMHD simulation shows a higher and faster ascend of the rope together with the overlying field lines, which further reconnect at the QSL located higher up in the corona. The foot points of the field lines match better with the observations for the HMHD case with the central part of the flare ribbon located at the chromosphere. Additionally, field lines are found to rotate in a circular pattern in the HMHD, whereas no such rotation is seen in the MHD results. Interestingly, plasma is also observed to be rotating in a co-spatial chromospheric region, which makes the HMHD simulation more credible. Based on the aforementioned agreements, HMHD simulation is found to agree better with observations and, thus, opens up a novel avenue to explore.",

A typical non-singular cyclic model within General Relativity requires a non-conventional fluid with negative effective energy density, in order to cancel the matter component and lead to a non-singular bounce. However, the existence of such a non-conventional fluid usually leads to quantum instabilities and makes the theory ill-defined. In the present work we follow the alternative way, obtaining two scenarios of non-singular cyclic cosmological evolutions in the context of gravitational theories beyond General Relativity. The degrees-of-freedom examination reveals that these two models are free of the Phantom Menace. Our analysis illustrates that, if cyclic cosmology describes overall universe, a theory of gravity beyond Einstein may be expected.",

      "summary": "The idea of the global gravitational effect as the source of cosmological redshift was considered by de Sitter (1916, 1917), Eddington (1923), Tolman (1929) and Bondi (1947). Also Hubble (1929) called the discovered distance-redshift relation as \"De Sitter effect\". For homogeneous matter distribution cosmological gravitational redshift is proportional to square of distance: z_grav ~ r^2. However for a fractal matter distribution having the fractal dimension D=2 the global gravitational redshift is the linear function of distance: z_grav ~ r, which gives possibility for interpretation of the Hubble law without the space expansion. Here the field gravity fractal cosmological model (FGF) is presented, which based on two initial principles. The first assumption is that the Feynman's field gravity approach describes the gravitational interaction, which delivers a natural basis for the conceptual unity of all fundamental physical interactions within the framework of the relativistic and quantum fields in Minkowski space. The second hypothesis is that the spatial distribution of gravitating matter is a fractal at all scales up to the Hubble radius. The fractal dimension of matter distribution is assumed to be D = 2, which implies that the global gravitational redshift is the explanation of the observed linear Hubble law. In the frame of the FGF all three phenomena - the cosmic background radiation, the fractal large scale structure, and the Hubble law, - could be the consequence of a unique large scale structure evolution process of the initially homogeneous ordinary matter without nonbaryonic matter and dark energy.",

We highlight three main surveys: a medium-deep continuum weak lensing and low-redshift spectroscopic HI galaxy survey over 5,000 sqdeg; a wide and deep continuum galaxy and HI intensity mapping survey over 20,000 sqdeg from z = 0.35 - 3; and a deep, high-redshift HI intensity mapping survey over 100 sqdeg from z = 3 - 6. Taken together, these surveys will achieve an array of important scientific goals: measuring the equation of state of dark energy out to z ~ 3 with percent-level precision measurements of the cosmic expansion rate; constraining possible deviations from General Relativity on cosmological scales by measuring the growth rate of structure through multiple independent methods; mapping the structure of the Universe on the largest accessible scales, thus constraining fundamental properties such as isotropy, homogeneity, and non-Gaussianity; and measuring the HI density and bias out to z = 6. These surveys will also provide highly complementary clustering and weak lensing measurements that have independent systematic uncertainties to those of optical surveys like LSST and Euclid, leading to a multitude of synergies that can improve constraints significantly beyond what optical or radio surveys can achieve on their own. This document, the 2018 Red Book, provides reference technical specifications, cosmological parameter forecasts, and an overview of relevant systematic effects for the three key surveys, and will be regularly updated by the Cosmology Science Working Group in the run up to start of operations and the Key Science Programme of SKA1.",

      "summary": "For most of its history, cosmology was a qualitatively constrained discourse on the universe, shaped by limited observational access and the absence of global dynamical laws. This situation has changed decisively in recent decades. Modern cosmology is now driven by an unprecedented flow of high-precision data from a wide range of independent probes, including the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, cosmic chronometers, redshift-space distortions, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and emerging 21-cm observations, among others. This observational wealth is matched by a concrete theoretical and mathematical framework, based on general relativity, which provides the dynamical equations governing the evolution of spacetime and matter at cosmic scales. Combined with explicit background and perturbative equations, this framework enables quantitative, predictive, and falsifiable descriptions of cosmic evolution. Thus, cosmology operates today as a nomological natural science of the observable universe, characterized by general laws, predictive power, and systematic empirical testing. We argue that this epistemic transformation motivates a corresponding conceptual shift, directly analogous to the historical transition from astrology to astronomy. In this sense, the transition from cosmology to \\emph{cosmonomy} should begin to be discussed among cosmologists, or, more precisely, among cosmonomers.",

This makes it possible to apply a wide range of constraints from large-scale structure, Type Ia supernovae, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background. Parameter scans can be performed using the many different statistical sampling algorithms available within the $\\sf{GAMBIT}$ framework, and results can be combined with calculations from other $\\sf{GAMBIT}$ modules focused on particle physics and dark matter.

The last period started with a epistemological optimism that has declined with time, and the expression \"crisis in cosmology\" is now stubbornly reverberating in the media. The initial expectation of removing the pending minor problems arising from the increased accuracy of measurements has backfired: the higher the precision with which the standard model tries to fit the data, the greater the number of tensions that arise, the problems proliferating rather than diminishing.",

Given $μ$, the order of Caputo's fractional derivative, and $w$, the matter equation of state, we present specific exact power-law solutions. We discuss the exact general solution of the Riccati Equation, where the solution for the scale factor is a combination of power laws. Using cosmological data, we estimate the free parameters. An analysis of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data and the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD), also known as cosmic chronometers, and a joint analysis with data from SNe Ia + OHD leads to best-fit values for the free parameters calculated at $1σ$, $2σ$ and $3σ$ confidence levels (CLs). On the other hand, these best-fit values are used to calculate the age of the Universe, the current deceleration parameter (both at $3σ$ CL) and the current matter density parameter at $1σ$ CL. Finding a Universe roughly twice as old as the one of $Λ$CDM is a distinction of fractional cosmology. Focusing our analysis on these results, we can conclude that the region in which $μ>2$ is not ruled out by observations. This parameter region is relevant because fractional cosmology gives a power-law solution without matter, which is accelerated for $μ>2$. We present a fractional origin model that leads to an accelerated state without appealing to $Λ$ or dark energy.",

      "summary": "Loop quantum cosmology is a tentative approach to model the universe down to the Planck era where quantum gravity settings are needed. The quantization of the universe as a dynamical space-time is inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity ideas. In addition, loop quantum cosmology could bridge contact with astronomical observations, and thus potentially investigate quantum cosmology modellings in the light of observations. To do so however, modelling both the background evolution and its perturbations is needed. The latter describe cosmic inhomogeneities that are the main cosmological observables. In this context, we present the so-called deformed algebra approach implementing the quantum corrections to the perturbed universe at an effective level by taking great care of gauge issues. We particularly highlight that in this framework, the algebra of hypersurface deformation receives quantum corrections, and we discuss their meaning. The primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor inhomogeneities are then presented, assuming initial conditions are set in the contracting phase preceding the quantum bounce and the well-known expanding phase of the cosmic history. These spectra are subsequently propagated to angular power spectra of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. It is then shown that regardless of the choice for the initial conditions inside the effective approach for the background evolution (except that they are set in the contracting phase), the predicted angular power spectra of the polarized B-modes exceed the upper bound currently set by observations. The exclusion of this specific version of loop quantum cosmology establishes the falsifiability of the approach, though one shall not conclude here that either loop quantum cosmology or loop quantum gravity is excluded.",

We simulate 1,000 surveys, with and without a conservative (volume-limited) version of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Deep Drilling Field SNe Ia, and compute Fisher-matrix-analysis Dark Energy Task Force Figures of Merit (FoM, based on w0-wa constraints) for each. We investigate which survey parameters correlate with FoM, as well as the dependence of the FoM values on calibration uncertainties and the SN dispersion model. The exact optimum depends on the assumed dispersion model and whether Rubin DDF SNe Ia are also considered, but ~20% time in prism, ~30--40% time in Wide imaging and the remainder in Deep imaging seems most promising. We also advocate for \"interlaced\" cadences where not every filter is used in every cadence step to reduce overheads while maintaining a good cadence and increasing the number of filters compared to the Rose et al. (2021) reference survey (the prism has proportionately lower overheads and can be used for each cadence step). We show simulated light curves and spectra for the baseline HLTDS CCS recommendation and release distance-modulus covariance matrices for all surveys to the community.",

For that purpose, we assume a Bianchi I cosmology, as the background geometry, and a bumblebee field coupled to it. Bumblebee models are examples of a mechanism for the Lorentz symmetry violation by assuming a nonzero vacuum expectation value for the bumblebee field. When coupled to the Bianchi I geometry, which is not in agreement with a cosmological principle, the bumblebee field plays the role of a source of anisotropies and produces a preferred axis. Thus, a fraction of the cosmic anisotropies would come from the Lorentz symmetry violation. In the last part of the article, we try to assume an upper bound on the bumblebee field using the quadrupole and octopole moments of the cosmic microwave background radiation.",

Using feasible interferometer technologies, we find that a lunar-based observatory is ideal for probing GW frequencies in the range between deci-Hz to 5 Hz, an astrophysically rich regime that is very challenging for both Earth- and space-based detectors. GLOC can survey binaries with neutron stars, stellar and intermediate-mass black holes to $\\gtrsim 70\\%$ of the observable volume of our universe without significant background contamination. The sensitivity at $\\mathcal{O}(1~\\mathrm{Hz})$ allows a unique window into calibrating Type Ia supernovae.

It is standard to point to the Planck scale (located at $\\sim 10^{-43}$ seconds after a fictitious \"Big Bang\" point) as a limit for how far back we may extrapolate the standard cosmological model. In our work we have suggested that there are several other (physically motivated) interesting limits -- located at least thirty orders of magnitude before the Planck time -- where the physical basis of the cosmological model and its time concept is progressively weakened. Some of these limits are connected to phase transitions in the early universe which gradually undermine the notion of 'standard clocks' widely employed in cosmology. Such considerations lead to a 'scale problem' for time which becomes particularly acute above the electroweak phase transition (before $\\sim 10^{-11}$ seconds). Other limits are due to problems of building up a cosmological reference frame, or even contemplating a sensible notion of proper time, if the early universe constituents become too quantum. This 'quantum problem' for time arises e.g. if a pure quantum phase is contemplated at the beginning of inflation at, say, $\\sim 10^{-34}$ seconds.",

The assumption of homogeneity is just a first approximation introduced to simplify equations. So far this assumption is commonly believed to have worked well, but future and more precise observations will not be properly analysed unless inhomogeneities are taken into account. This paper reviews recent developments in the field and shows the importance of an inhomogeneous framework in the analysis of cosmological observations.",

The first law essentially provides the change of the entropy of the apparent horizon during the cosmic evolution of the universe, in particular, it is given by: $TdS = -d(ρV) + W dV$ (where $W$ is the work density and other quantities have their usual meaning). In this way, the first law actually links various theories of gravity with the entropy of the apparent horizon. This leads to a natural question -- ``what will be the form of the horizon entropy corresponding to a general modified theory of gravity?'' The second law of horizon thermodynamics states that the change of total entropy (the sum of horizon entropy $+$ matter fields' entropy) with respect to cosmic time must be positive, where the matter fields behave like an open system characterised by a non-zero chemical potential. The second law of horizon thermodynamics importantly provides model-independent constraints on entropic parameters. Finally, we discuss the standpoint of entropic cosmology on inflation (or bounce), reheating and primordial gravitational waves from the perspective of generalised entropy function.",

The analysis is designed to search for coincident excitations in multiple detectors. The data set analysed in this article covers a longer period and is more complete than that given in previous reports. The current analysis is more accurate for determining the false dismissal probability for a time coincidence search and it optimizes the search with respect to a target amplitude and direction of the signal. The statistics of the accidental coincidences agrees with the model used for drawing the results. The observations of this IGEC search are consistent with no detection of gravitational wave burst events. A new conservative upper limit has been set on the rate of gravitational wave bursts with Fourier component H > 2 10^{-21}Hz^{-1}, both for searches with and without a filter for the Galactic Center direction. This study confirms that the false alarm rate of the observation can be negligible when at least three detectors are operating simultaneously.",

For accelerated point masses, it is known that gravitational radiation is beamed isotropicly at high speeds, and beamed along the polar axis at low speeds. Aside from this knowledge, there has been very little work done on beaming of gravitational radiation from GRBs, and the impact beaming could have on gravitational wave (GW) detection. We determine the following: (1) the observation angle at which the most power is emitted as a function of speed, (2) the maximum ratio of power radiated away as a function of speed, and (3) the angular distribution of power ratios at relativistic and non-relativistic speeds. Additionally the dependence of the beaming of GW radiation on speed is essentially the opposite of the beaming of electromagnetic (EM) radiation from GRBs. So we investigate why this is the case by calculating the angular EM radiation distribution from a linear electric quadrupole, and compare this distribution to the angular gravitational radiation distribution from a GRB.",

For black holes that are similar in mass to the Sun, scientists use the LIGO detector on Earth. But for the biggest black holes in the Universe (billions of times more massive than the Sun), scientists monitor a net of rapidly-spinning neutron stars (called pulsars) across the Milky Way. Any gravitational wave passing by will change how long radio signals from these pulsars take to get to Earth. The NANOGrav Collaboration monitored 34 of these pulsars over 11 years, in an attempt to detect gravitational waves from giant black holes.",

Second, we motivate, formulate and then discuss Einstein's equation, which relates the geometry of spacetime to its matter content. Gravitational waves are later introduced as solutions of the linearized Einstein equation around flat spacetime. These waves are shown to propagate at the speed of light and to possess two polarization states. Gravitational waves can interact with matter, allowing for their direct detection by means of laser interferometers. Finally, Einstein's quadrupole formulas are derived and used to show that nonspherical compact objects moving at relativistic speeds are powerful gravitational wave sources.",

As shown in the previous study, the gravitational wave signals appearing in the numerical simulation can be well identified with the gravity (fundamental) oscillation in the early (later) phase before (after) the avoided crossing between the gravity and fundamental oscillations. On the other hand, the time evolution of supernova gravitational waves strongly depends on the PNS models, such as the progenitor mass and the equation of state for dense matter. Nevertheless, we find that the fundamental and gravity mode frequencies according to the gravitational wave signals appearing in the numerical simulations can be expressed as a function of the protoneutron star average density independently of the PNS models. Using the average density, we derive the empirical formula for supernova gravitational wave frequency. In addition, we confirm that the dependence of the PNS surface density on the PNS average density is almost independent of the PNS models and also discuss how the different treatment of the non-uniform matter in the equation of state affects the observables.",

Newborn neutron stars rotating more rapidly than about 100Hz may spin down to that frequency during up to one year after the supernova that gives them birth, emitting gravitational waves which might be detectable by the enhanced LIGO interferometers at a distance which includes several supernovae per year. A cosmological background of these events may be detectable by advanced LIGO. The spins (about 300Hz) of neutron stars in low-mass x-ray binaries may also be due to the r-mode instability (under different conditions), and some of these systems in our galaxy may also produce detectable gravitational waves--see the review by G. Ushomirsky in this volume. Much work is in progress on developing our understanding of r-mode astrophysics to refine the early, optimistic estimates of the detectability of the gravitational waves.",

To produce primordial black holes which contribute a non-negligible abundance of dark matter and are consistent with the observations, a large enhancement in the primordial curvature power spectrum is needed. For a single field slow-roll inflation, the enhancement requires a very flat potential for the inflaton, and this will increase the number of $e$-folds. To avoid the problem, an ultra-slow-roll inflation at the near inflection point is required. We elaborate the conditions to successfully produce primordial black hole dark matter from single field inflation and propose a toy model with polynomial potential to realize the big enhancement of the curvature power spectrum at small scales while maintaining the consistency with the observations at large scales. The power spectrum for the second order gravitational waves generated by the large density perturbations at small scales is consistent with the current pulsar timing array observations.",

The gravitational waves from such binaries can change drastically depending on how large the eccentricity is, ranging from emitted in small a subset of orbital harmonics at low eccentricities, to being concentrated into intense bursts of radiation from each pericenter passage at large eccentricities. Gravitational waves from such highly eccentric binaries present themselves an intriguing systems for probing fundamental physics, but also present interesting challenges in terms of detection. The presence of orbital eccentricity in the gravitational wave signature gives an unequivocal method of determining the origin of the binary, while the highly dynamical nature of pericenter passage often enhances the physics associated with matter and gravity. The generation of faithful models of the repeated burst signals has proven challenging, and often sub-optimal detection strategies like power stacking are considered for detection. This chapter reviews our current understanding of eccentric binaries, the leading efforts to model their gravitational wave emission, and the physics that can be probed with these detections.",

While the energy of this co-produced electromagnetic and sound radiation is orders of magnitude smaller than the initiating gravitational radiation, the power may be sufficient to re-ignite fusion outside the collapsing core. The non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion, in roughly the same time frame as the strongest neutrino emissions, would change the configuration of the pre-supernova star and subsequently the ejecta and the evolution of the stellar expansion of the supernova remnant. Although the co-produced electromagnetic or sound radiation could not contribute directly to the supernova explosion, the associated non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion would alter the state outside the core leaving an observable signature in the ejecta of the supernova remnant. The aim of this paper is to argue that including this hypothesized co-produced radiation in computational models of core collapse supernovae would contribute to the evolution of the stellar expansion and consequently should be observable in the supernovae remnant, providing a confirmation of the conversion processes for gravitational radiation to electromagnetic and sound radiation.",

Then, we find that the ramp up signals correspond well to the $g_1$-mode in the early phase and to the $f$-mode, to which the $g_1$-mode is exchanged via the avoided crossing. We also confirm that the $f$- and $g_1$-modes are almost independent of the selection of the PNS surface density in the later phase after core bounce. In addition, we successfully find that the fitting formula of $g_1$- and $f$-modes, which correspond to the ramp up signals in the numerical simulation, as a function of the PNS average density. That is, via the direct observation of the gravitational waves after supernova explosion, one could extract the time evolution of the PNS average density by using our fitting formula.",

We use the  Cowling approximation, neglecting spacetime perturbations, and consider different models of evolving PNS. The frequencies of the modes of a PNS are considerably lower than those of a cold NS, and are further lowered by rotation; consequently, if QNMs were excited in a sufficiently energetic process, they would radiate waves that could be more easily detectable by resonant-mass and interferometric detectors than those emitted by a cold NS. We find that for high rotation rates, some of the g-modes become unstable via the CFS instability; however, this instability is likely to be suppressed by competing mechanisms before emitting a significant amount of gravitational waves.",

      "summary": "The renewed serious interest to possible practical applications of gravitational waves is encouraging. Building on previous work, I am arguing that the strong variable electromagnetic fields are appropriate systems for the generation and detection of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW). The advantages of electromagnetic systems are clearly seen in the proposed complete laboratory experiment, where one has to ensure the efficiency of, both, the process of generation and the process of detection of HFGW. Within the family of electromagnetic systems, one still has a great variety of possible geometrical configurations, classical and quantum states of the electromagnetic field, detection strategies, etc. According to evaluations performed 30 years ago, the gap between the HFGW laboratory signal and its level of detectability is at least 4 orders of magnitude. Hopefully, new technologies of today can remove this gap and can make the laboratory experiment feasible. The laboratory experiment is bound to be expensive, but one should remember that a part of the cost is likely to be reimbursed from the Nobel prize money ! Electromagnetic systems seem also appropriate for the detection of high-frequency end of the spectrum of relic gravitational waves. Although the current effort to observe the stochastic background of relic gravitational waves is focused on the opposite, very low-frequency, end of the spectrum, it would be extremely valuable for fundamental science to detect, or put sensible upper limits on, the high-frequency relic gravitational waves. I will briefly discuss the origin of relic gravitational waves, the expected level of their high-frequency signal, and the existing estimates of its detectability.",

Here, we highlight the science aims and describe the gravitational wave signals expected from the sources and the information gathered in it. We show that the observation of gravitational wave sources will play a transformative role in our understanding of the processes ruling the formation and evolution of stars and black holes, galaxy clustering and evolution, the nature of the strong forces in neutron star interiors, and the most mysterious interaction of Nature: gravity.

Surprisingly, the nonlinear memory affects the signal amplitude starting at leading (Newtonian-quadrupole) order. Despite this fact, the nonlinear memory is not easily extracted from current numerical relativity simulations. After reviewing the linear and nonlinear memory I summarize some recent work, including: (1) computations of the memory contribution to the inspiral waveform amplitude (thus completing the waveform to third post-Newtonian order); (2) the first calculations of the nonlinear memory that include all phases of binary black hole coalescence (inspiral, merger, ringdown); and (3) realistic estimates of the detectability of the memory with LISA.",

After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide.",

At higher frequencies a few thousand double white dwarfs are resolved individually. Including compact binaries containing neutron stars and black holes in our calculations yields a further few hundred resolved binaries and some tens which can be detected above the double white dwarf noise at low frequencies.

First of all we focus on the r-mode instability and show that a 'minimal' neutron star model (which does not incorporate exotica in the core, dynamically important magnetic fields or superfluid degrees of freedom), is not consistent with observations. We then present estimates of both thermally induced and magnetically sustained mountains in the crust. In general magnetic mountains are likely to be detectable only if the buried magnetic field of the star is of the order of $B\\approx 10^{12}$ G. In the thermal mountain case we find that gravitational wave emission from persistent systems may be detected by ground based interferometers. Finally we re-asses the idea that gravitational wave emission may be balancing the accretion torque in these systems, and show that in most cases the disc/magnetosphere interaction can account for the observed spin periods.",

      "summary": "The radiation-dominated universe is a key ingredient of the standard Big Bang cosmology. Radiation comprises numerous quantum elementary particles, and the macroscopic behavior of radiation is described by taking the quantum thermal average of its constituents. While the interactions between individual particles and gravitational waves are often neglected in this context, it raises the question of whether these elementary particles interact with gravitational waves in the framework of quantum field theory. To address this question, this paper aims to explore the quantum mechanical aspects of gravitational waves in a universe dominated by a massless scalar field, whose averaged energy-momentum tensor plays the role of background radiation. We establish the equivalence between the classical Einstein equation and the mean-field approximation of the Heisenberg equation in a local thermal state. Beyond the mean-field approximation, we analyze the quantum corrections to gravitational waves, particularly focusing on the thermal radiation loop corrections. Interestingly, we find the 1-loop correction surpasses the tree-level spectrum of primordial gravitational waves, which is $O(α^2)$ where $α=H_{\\rm inf}/M_{\\rm pl}$ is the ratio of the inflationary Hubble parameter to the Planck mass. Then, to see if this result persists even if we take into account all the higher order loop corrections, the loop expansion is reorganized in the series expansion in $α$. We schematically discuss two-loop diagrams that may give $O(α^2)$ contributions. We leave explicit computations of these diagrams for future studies. Thus, although we cannot claim that the whole loop corrections exceed the tree-level spectrum at the moment, our findings highlight the significance of quantum effects when studying the interaction between radiation and gravitational waves in the cosmological context.",

We estimate the intensity of GWs produced at quantum and classical scattering of PBHs, the classical graviton emission from the PBH binaries in the early Universe, and the graviton emission due to PBH evaporation. If nonrelativistic PBHs dominated the cosmological energy density prior to their evaporation, the probability of formation of dense clusters of PBHs and their binaries in such clusters would be significant and the energy density of the generated gravitational waves in the present day universe could exceed that produced by other known mechanisms. The intensity of these gravitational waves would be maximal in the GHz frequency band of the spectrum or higher and makes their observation very difficult by present detectors but also gives a rather good possibility to investigate it by present and future high frequency gravitational waves electromagnetic detectors. However, the low frequency part of the spectrum in the range $f\\sim 0.1-10$ Hz may be detectable by the planned space interferometers DECIGO/BBO. For sufficiently long duration of the PBH matter dominated stage the cosmological energy fraction of GWs from inflation would be noticeably diluted.",

The local form of the effective action associated with the trace anomaly is expressed in terms of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the conformal factor of the spacetime metric, allowing it to propagate over macroscopic distances. Linearized around flat spacetime, this semi-classical EFT admits scalar gravitational wave solutions in addition to the transversely polarized tensor waves of the classical Einstein theory. The amplitude of the scalar wave modes, as well as their energy and energy flux which are positive and contain a monopole moment, are computed. Astrophysical sources for scalar gravitational waves are considered, with the excited gluonic condensates in the interiors of neutron stars in merger events with other compact objects likely to provide the strongest burst signals.",

Recent findings from looking at distant supernovae revealed that the rate of expansion of our universe is accelerating, which may be well-explained by sticking in a positive cosmological constant into the Einstein field equations for general relativity. By solving the Newman-Penrose equations (which are equivalent to the Einstein field equations), we generalise this notion of Bondi mass-energy and thereby provide a firm theoretical description of how an isolated gravitating system loses energy as it radiates gravitational waves, in a universe that expands at an accelerated rate. This is in line with the observational front of LIGO's first announcement in February 2016 that gravitational waves from the merger of a binary black hole system have been detected.",

This technique relies on the symmetry of the motion around the Sun of an Earth-bound gravitational wave interferometer. By multiplying the measured data time series with a half-year time-shifted copy of it, we obtain two advantages: (i) the main Doppler phase modulation of a monochromatic gravitational wave signal is exactly removed, and (ii) the signal in the product data are located at twice the GW signal frequency. The first significantly reduces the size of the signal's parameter space over which a search is to be performed. The second is advantageous at low frequencies; we find that, with currently available computer processing speeds, this technique is capable of achieving sensitivity that is comparable to or even better than coherent and other possibly non-coherent methods. Further, since our proposed method is implemented over a year-long data segment, it requires processing time comparable to the data acquisition time of currently available computers.",

      "summary": "We develop a new nonlinear mean field dynamo theory that couples field growth to the time evolution of the magnetic helicity and the turbulent electromotive force, $\\emfb$. We show that the difference between kinetic and current helicities emerges naturally as the growth driver when the time derivative of $\\emfb$ is coupled into the theory. The solutions predict significant field growth in a kinematic phase and a saturation rate/strength that is magnetic Reynolds number dependent/independent in agreement with numerical simulations. The amplitude of early time oscillations provides a diagnostic for the closure.",

      "summary": "Recent work on neutrino oscillations suggests that the three generations of fermions in the standard model are related by representations of the finite group A(4), the group of symmetries of the tetrahedron. Motivated by this, we explore models which extend the EPRL model for quantum gravity by coupling it to a bosonic quantum field of representations of A(4). This coupling is possible because the representation category of A(4) is a module category over the representation categories used to construct the EPRL model. The vertex operators which interchange vacua in the resulting quantum field theory reproduce the bosons and fermions of the standard model, up to issues of symmetry breaking which we do not resolve. We are led to the hypothesis that physical particles in nature represent vacuum changing operators on a sea of invisible excitations which are only observable in the A(4) representation labels which govern the horizontal symmetry revealed in neutrino oscillations. The quantum field theory of the A(4) representations is just the dual model on the extended lattice of the Lie group $E_6$, as explained by the quantum Mckay correspondence of Frenkel Jing and Wang. The coupled model can be thought of as string field theory, but propagating on a discretized quantum spacetime rather than a classical manifold.",

Central to the definition of colored $\\ast$-operads is the involutive monoidal category of symmetric sequences, which we obtain from a general product-exponential $2$-adjunction whose right adjoint forms involutive functor categories. For $\\ast$-algebras over $\\ast$-operads we obtain involutive analogs of the usual change of color and operad adjunctions. As an application, we turn the colored operads for algebraic quantum field theory into colored $\\ast$-operads. The simplest instance is the associative $\\ast$-operad, whose $\\ast$-algebras are unital and associative $\\ast$-algebras.",

This talk is a report on work in progress, in which we consider the fate of one specific primordial field scenario, driven by pseudoscalar effects near the electroweak phase transition. We argue that such a scenario has a number of attractive features, although it is still uncertain whether a field of appropriate size can survive until late times.",

Faraday's Law says that an electric field is needed to create a magnetic field. Previous authors relied on conventional Ohm's law to calculate E, but the resistivity is negligible and therefore they assume E is as well. We use a modified Ohm's Law that includes the effects of self-induction in limiting the current driven by a given E, which allows a magnetic field to grow.",

      "summary": "Mean field dynamo theory is a leading candidate to explain the observed large scale magnetic fields of galaxies and stars. However, controversy arises over the extent of premature quenching by the backreaction of the growing field. We distinguish between rapid mean field dynamo action, which is required by astrophysical systems, and resistively limited action. We show how the flow of magnetic helicity is important for rapid action. Existing numerical and analytic work suggesting that mean field dynamos are prematurely quenched and resistively limited include approximations or boundary conditions which suppress the magnetic helicity flow from the outset. Thus they do not unambiguously reveal whether real astrophysical mean field dynamos are dynamically suppressed when the helicity flow is allowed. An outflow of helicity also implies an outflow of magnetic energy and so active coronae or winds should accompany mean field dynamos. Open boundaries alone may not be sufficient for rapid dynamo action and the additional physics of buoyancy and outflows may be required. Possible simulation approaches to test some of the principles are briefly discussed. Some limitations of the ``Zeldovich relation'' are also addressed.",

The absence of a background space-time metric in these theories gives rise to a host of conceptual and technical difficulties because most of the familiar methods from axiomatic, constructive and perturbative quantum field theory are no longer applicable. Perhaps the most striking examples of these problems arise in the construction of a quantum field theory of geometry. We show that these problems can be tackled using new non-perturbative methods. In particular, one can rigorously define certain geometric operators and show that their spectrum is discrete.

      "summary": "Forthcoming exascale digital computers will further advance our knowledge of quantum chromodynamics, but formidable challenges will remain. In particular, Euclidean Monte Carlo methods are not well suited for studying real-time evolution in hadronic collisions, or the properties of hadronic matter at nonzero temperature and chemical potential. Digital computers may never be able to achieve accurate simulations of such phenomena in QCD and other strongly-coupled field theories; quantum computers will do so eventually, though I'm not sure when. Progress toward quantum simulation of quantum field theory will require the collaborative efforts of quantumists and field theorists, and though the physics payoff may still be far away, it's worthwhile to get started now. Today's research can hasten the arrival of a new era in which quantum simulation fuels rapid progress in fundamental physics.",

      "summary": "In the present article we display a new constructive quantum field theory approach to quantum gauge field theory, utilizing the recent progress in the integration theory on the moduli space of generalized connections modulo gauge transformations. That is, we propose a new set of Osterwalder Schrader like axioms for the characteristic functional of a measure on the space of generalized connections modulo gauge transformations rather than for the associated Schwinger distributions. We show non-triviality of our axioms by demonstrating that they are satisfied for two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on the plane and the cylinder. As a side result we derive a closed and analytical expression for the vacuum expectation value of an arbitrary product of Wilson loop functionals from which we derive the quantum theory along the Glimm and Jaffe algorithm which agrees exactly with the one as obtained by canonical methods.",

The dilaton is related to the object of non-metricity.",

      "summary": "Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.",

      "summary": "Josephson junction parametric amplifiers have become essential tools for microwave quantum circuit readout with minimal added noise. Even after improving at an impressive rate in the last decade, they remain vulnerable to magnetic field, which limits their use in many applications such as spin qubits, Andreev and molecular magnet devices, dark matter searches, etc. Kinetic inductance materials, such as granular aluminum (grAl), offer an alternative source of non-linearity with innate magnetic field resilience. We present a non-degenerate amplifier made of two coupled grAl resonators resilient to in-plane magnetic field up to 1 T. It offers 20 dB of gain close to the quantum limit of added noise, with a gain-bandwidth product of 28 MHz and -110 dBm input saturation power.",
