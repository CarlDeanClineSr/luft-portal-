      "summary": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.",

      "summary": "We propose a mechanism for the generation of gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era. Coupled to an ultralight axion field through a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, dark photons can be produced by the tachyonic instability of axion coherent oscillation. The dark photons with a net helicity lead to a metric vorticity and can generate chiral substructures. For axion masses in the range $10^{-28} \\, \\mathrm{eV} \\lesssim m_a \\lesssim 10^{-22} \\, \\mathrm{eV}$, the resulting inhomogeneities collapse to form halos with masses spanning $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^5 \\, M_{\\odot}$ to $10^{11} \\, M_{\\odot}$, with halo sizes ranging from $O(1)$ to $O(10^{6}) \\, \\mathrm{pc}$.

      "summary": "In cosmology, long-wavelength modes are related to large-gauge transformations (LGT), i.e. changes of coordinates that modify the physical geometry of the cosmological patch. These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner.",

By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics, we show that the DM halo shifts the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) outward, reflecting its modification of the spacetime geometry and the energy-angular momentum structure of particle motion. Employing a semi-analytical method, we compute orbital trajectories and the associated GW waveforms, revealing that the DM halo alters the characteristic zoom-whirl dynamics and induces measurable changes in waveform morphology. Furthermore, we generate direct and secondary images of the accretion disk across various observer inclinations and find that increasing $r_{s}$ or $\u03c1_{s}$ results in cooler, dimmer disks with modified flux distributions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo imprints distinct signatures in both gravitational and electromagnetic observables, offering a multimessenger pathway to probe DM environments near BHs.",

As a simple but representative setup, we consider conformal scalar, Weyl fermion, and Maxwell fields that provide the background radiation, and we ask whether the resulting damping and phase shift of gravitational waves retain any memory of their spins. We revisit this question in a real-time quantum-field-theoretic framework, where the stress tensor splits into a background part, a dynamical (history-dependent) response, and local contact terms, with an additional on-shell projection fixed by the Friedmann equation. We find that the dynamical spin-dependent response arises on a short time scale characterized by the radiation temperature, which is exactly canceled by the local responses. As a result, the remaining long-time response is universal and consistent with kinetic theory in the hard thermal limit. Although the underlying mechanism exhibits strong spin dependence, it leaves no observable imprint on the large-scale effective dynamics of gravitational waves in this setup.",

We model these effects through a parameterized waveform framework that incorporates a set of parameters that quantify potential deviations from general relativity. The frequency-dependence of their effects is described by power-law indices $\u03b2$ (i.e., $\u03b2_{\\bar \u03bd}$, $\u03b2_{\\bar \u03bc}$, $\u03b2_\u03bd$, and $\u03b2_\u03bc$). By analyzing events such as a high-signal noise ratio (SNR) \"golden event\" like GW250114 and a massive binary system like GW231123 (total mass $190-265 M_\\odot$) using two networks of ground- and space-based detectors, we demonstrate that multi-band observations can significantly improve the current constraints on Lorentz and parity violations by several order of magnitude, for both high-frequency ($\u03b2> 0$) and low-frequency ($\u03b2< 0$) modifications. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that while the exceptional SNR of the GW250114-like event yields superior constraints for high-frequency modifications ($\u03b2> 0$), the massive nature of GW231123 provides more stringent limits for low-frequency effects ($\u03b2< 0$). This work highlights the critical value of future multi-band gravitational wave astronomy for conducting precision tests of general relativity across diverse binary populations.",

The conserved current density is modified from $|\u03c8|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\u03c8|^2/ \\mathbf{1}^2[\\mathcal{C}]$, where $\\mathbf 1[\\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\u00f6dinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field.

In beyond-vacuum scenarios, the evolution of an EMRI immersed in a cold dark matter environment modifies the gravitational wave flux and introduces additional dissipative effects such as dynamical friction. In parallel, in the beyond-general relativistic settings such as in sGB gravity, the inspiraling object carries an effective scalar charge and emits scalar radiation. Both environmental and modified-gravity effects modify the flux-balance law, thereby inducing changes in the EMRI dynamics. Using a two-timescale analysis within the fixed-frequency formalism, we compute leading-order corrections to the energy fluxes for quasi-circular, equatorial orbits in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes and construct the corresponding gravitational waveforms, which are used to quantify the accumulated gravitational wave dephasing and waveform mismatch relative to the vacuum general relativistic case. We further perform the Fisher Information Matrix analysis to estimate parameter correlations and the ability of future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to disentangle environmental and modified gravity effects. Our results show that both dark matter and scalar field effects can leave measurable imprints on EMRI waveforms and that a consistent beyond-vacuum treatment is essential for robust tests of gravity.",

In semiclassical gravity, this interplay culminates in the generalized second law (GSL), whose modern proofs rely on information theoretic techniques applied to algebras of observables defined on null hypersurfaces. These proofs exhibit close structural parallels with the thermodynamics of open quantum systems governed by Markovian dynamics. In this work, we draw parallels between the dynamics of quantum fields in regions bounded by non expanding causal horizons and the thermodynamics of quantum systems weakly coupled to equilibrium reservoirs. We introduce a dictionary relating late time boundary conditions to the choice of reservoir, vacuum states to fixed points of the dynamics, and modular Hamiltonians to thermodynamic potentials. Building on results from a companion paper on dual generalized second laws at future null infinity, we show that additional terms appearing in the associated thermodynamic potentials admit a natural interpretation as work contributions. We demonstrate that certain non thermal vacuum states at null infinity allow for the operation of autonomous thermal engines and enable work extraction from the radiation. Extending the analysis to the Unruh vacuum in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds, we obtain generalized grand potential type laws incorporating grey body effects and angular momentum fluxes. Altogether, our results clarify the thermodynamic description of black hole dynamics and place it within the broader framework of open quantum thermodynamics.",

      "summary": "The generalized second law (GSL) of black hole thermodynamics asserts the monotonic increase of the generalized entropy combining the black hole area and the entropy of quantum fields outside the horizon. Modern proofs of the GSL rely on information theoretic methods and are typically formulated using algebras of observables defined on the event horizon together with a vacuum state invariant under horizon symmetries, inducing a geometric modular flow. In this work, we formulate a dual version of the generalized second law from the perspective of asymptotic observers at future null infinity, who do not have access to the black hole area. Our approach exploits the dependence of the second law on the choice of algebra of observables and of a reference state invariant under suitable symmetries, in close analogy with open quantum thermodynamics. Using algebraic quantum field theory and modular theory, we analyze several physically motivated vacuum states, including the Hartle Hawking state and two classes of regularized vacua. We show that, at null infinity, the monotonic quantity governing an irreversible evolution is no longer the generalized entropy, but rather a thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables. Depending on the chosen vacuum, this potential takes the form of the free energy or of a generalized grand potential built from the Bondi mass and additional (angular) mode dependent chemical potentials. The resulting inequalities define a dual generalized second law at future null infinity, which can be consistently combined with the standard GSL involving variations of the black hole area.",

This milestone represents a major advancement for GW cosmology, as many methods, particularly those employing the spectral siren approach, critically depend on the number of available sources. We investigate the impact of a novel parametric model describing the full population mass spectrum of CBCs on the estimation of the Hubble constant. This model is designed to test the impact of heavy black holes in GW cosmology. We perform a joint inference of cosmological and population parameters using 142 CBCs from GWTC-4.0 with a false alarm rate smaller than 0.25 per year, using both spectral and dark siren approaches. With spectral sirens, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 78.8^{+19.0}_{-15.3}\\,{\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), while the dark siren method yields $H_0 = 82.5^{+16.8}_{-14.3}\\,{\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL). These results improve the uncertainty by approximately 30.4% and 36.2%, respectively.

Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3H\u03b4\u03c1_{\\rm de}$ and $Q=3H\u03b4\\left(\\tfrac{\u03c1_{\\rm de}^2}{\u03c1_{\\rm dm}+\u03c1_{\\rm de}}\\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}>-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}<-1$) in the past at high redshift. These results highlight the promising, but problematic, nature of dark sector interactions, as well as the need to extend the analysis using early-time physics and datasets.",

      "summary": "We have examined the cosmological actions of LRS (Locally Rationally Symmetric) Bianchi type-I universe model in $f(R,T^\u03c8)$ gravity. For this, we have estimated the Hubble parameter, the effective equation of state parameter ($\u03c9^{eff}$), and the potential of the scalar field as a function of time using equation $H = W(\u03c8)$. The graphical representation of the potential function $V(\u03c8)$ with respect to cosmic time t is described. This study explores the dynamical properties of a Bianchi Type-I universe by utilizing Bayesian statistical techniques to constrain the model parameters and evaluate the viability of anisotropic cosmology under extended matter-geometry couplings. Also, we have applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism on the derived $H(z)$ model by using observational Hubble data (OHD), the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) dataset, and the Pantheon dataset. From the confidence-level contours and best-fit parameter values obtained, along with the corresponding reduced $\u03c7^{2}$, it is evident that the model aligns strongly with observational data, demonstrating statistical stability and consistency in describing late-time cosmic acceleration. Likewise, the error analyses presented in this research, including a comparison between the $\u039b$CDM cosmology and the reconstructed $H(z)$ model, confirm the model's compatibility with current observations by yielding a reliable and accurate account of the universe's expansion history.",

We analyze the dynamics of charged particles on circular orbits and derive the corresponding radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. The influence of the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, magnetic coupling, dyonic charge, and quintessence state parameter on the innermost stable circular orbit and epicyclic frequencies is examined in detail. Using the forced resonance model, we compare the theoretical predictions of high-frequency QPOs with observational data from several X-ray binary systems. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis is employed to constrain the black hole parameters and assess the role of weak magnetization and nonlinear electrodynamics effects. This analysis indicates that QPO observations tightly constrain the black hole mass and orbital radius while placing stringent upper bounds on the ModMax coupling, magnetic interaction, and dyonic charge. In addition, we study the radiative properties of the accretion disk and analyze the effects of the model parameters on the disk flux and temperature profiles. These findings suggest that the observed QPOs are consistent with general relativity in the strong-field regime, allowing only small deviations associated with Einstein-Maxwell theory in the presence of a quintessence field.",

      "summary": "Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) suggests that the dark energy in our universe might be evolving, favoring the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization and a lower Hubble constant. In our previous work, it has been reported that cosmological model with the non-singular bounce inflation (BI) scenario and $\u039b$CDM might alleviate the Hubble tension into 3$\u03c3$ confidence. In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \\texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \\texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \\ \\mathrm{km} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \\cdot \\mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \\pm 2.1 \\ \\mathrm{km} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \\cdot \\mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case. After considering nontrivial weak lensing effect and spatial curvature as well as adding \\texttt{Pantheon+}, BI fits 3.1$\u03c3$ confidence of $\u039b$CDM with $w_ 0 = -0.919 \\pm 0.038$ and $w_{ \\mathrm{a}} = -0.37 \\pm 0.12$, and it prefers evolving dark energy than the PL case with $w_ 0 = -0.960 \\pm 0.074$ and $w_{ \\mathrm{a}} = -0.15^{ +0.28}_{ -0.25}$.",

Periodic orbits are classified by integer triplets and exhibit characteristic zoom whirl behavior. Based on these orbits we compute the corresponding GW signals in both the polarizations.

      "summary": "We explore the transition from the $\u039b$CDM to an interacting dark sector by introducing a model with a redshift threshold that controls the onset of the energy transfer between the dark energy and the dark matter. Below the transition redshift, the interaction between dark matter and dark energy becomes active, while at earlier times the cosmological evolution coincides with that of $\u039b$CDM. This approach allows us to determine the epoch in the comic history where the interacting effects have an impact in the description of the dark sector. We constrain the free parameters of the model using late-time cosmological observations, namely Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernova data from the Pantheon Plus, Union3.0, and DES-Dovekie catalogues. The analysis provides an indication of a strong interacting term that describes energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, which is activated at low redshifts. The PantheonPlus sample provides a threshold of $z_{T}<0.624$, the Union3.0 sample yields $z_{T}=0.400_{-0.23}^{+0.021}$, and the DES-Dovekie sample gives $z_{T}=0.371_{-0.26}^{+0.028}$. The model fits the data in a similar way to the CPL parametrization, without the dark energy to cross the phantom divide line.",

This is done fully considering backreaction of the local geometry on the cosmological dynamics. Our solution is free of curvature singularities at the would-be BH event horizon, thus solving a main issue of the CE of BH solutions proposed so far.

After deriving the modified Friedmann equations within the thermodynamic-gravity conjecture, we study the background evolution in both non-interacting and interacting dark sector scenarios, emphasizing the role of the entropic parameter in shaping late-time dynamics. We then confront the model with state-of-the-art observations, including PantheonPlus and Union3 Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers and DESI DR2 BAO measurements. Using Bayesian MCMC methods, we constrain the model parameters and compare the performance of BHDE with that of $\u039b$CDM. Our results show that BHDE is compatible with current data and can exhibit a mild statistical preference over the concordance model for certain dataset combinations. Overall, the analysis underscores the relevance of generalized entropy frameworks in late-time cosmology and identifies Barrow-Tsallis holography with the GO cutoff as a competitive alternative to $\u039b$CDM.",

Here, we study in detail the resonant excitation of SMBH modes driven by a nearby stellar-mass binary. The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response.",
