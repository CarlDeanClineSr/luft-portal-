      "summary": "As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates.",

      "summary": "Particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations are currently among the most advanced tools to investigate particle acceleration at relativistic shocks. Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \\emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $\u03b5_{\\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.",

Several methods have been developed to perform rapid Bayesian inference, but they are not yet used to inform our full analyses. We present a novel approach for doing this whilst ensuring that the Bayesian prior remains independent of the data, providing a statistically rigorous way to leverage low-latency information to accelerate the final inference. By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\\times$ for binaries with SNRs $< 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories.",

      "summary": "We develop a machine learning model based on a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to reconstruct and generate neutron star (NS) equations of state (EOS). The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\\%)$ for $(M_{\\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS.",

      "summary": "We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.",

The Fischler-Kundu\\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \\cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.",

These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals.",

Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis.

A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).",

While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.",

To assess the statistical significance of periodic features embedded in red-noise-dominated variability, we apply several complementary timing techniques, including the Lomb--Scargle periodogram, weighted wavelet $Z$-transform, date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, REDFIT assuming an AR(1) process, and damped random walk modelling. The analyses reveal a dominant quasi-periodic modulation on a timescale of $\\sim600$--630~d, together with a secondary longer-timescale feature near $\\sim1050$--1110~d. Monte Carlo simulations show that the shorter-period signal exceeds the highest local confidence levels, while the longer modulation reaches $\\gtrsim99$ per cent local significance in several tests; independent DRW-based simulations place both peaks above the $4\u03c3$ envelope in the Lomb--Scargle analysis. Spectral-window diagnostics indicate that the detected periodicities are not artefacts of uneven sampling, and a sliding-window analysis shows that the QPO power is episodic across the $\\sim11$~yr baseline. We discuss possible physical interpretations in terms of geometric Doppler modulation associated with jet precession or helical motion, accretion-driven instabilities, and SMBBH-induced dynamics.",

      "summary": "We present a comprehensive study of perturbation theory for neutrino decoherence in power-law correlated turbulent matter, establishing rigorous convergence criteria and providing detailed numerical validation. Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \\propto t^{-\u03bd}e^{-t/\u03c4_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\u03be$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\\cos 2\u03b8_m \\approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\u03be< \u03be_c \\approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\u03be= 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\\sim 1\\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\u03bd\\geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.",

Spatially, a new extended $\u03b3$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$\u03b1$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified. This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Spectrally, the cloud-associated emission implies an underlying cosmic-ray (CR) proton population described by a hard power law with an index of $\u0393\\approx 2.1$, compatible with the standard diffusive shock acceleration prediction. We interpret the $\u03b3$-ray emission in this region with a hadronic scenario involving two distinct CR populations: trapped CRs reaccelerated within the radiative SNR shell as proposed in previous work, and escaping CRs illuminating the nearby MCs. The derived CR proton intensity in the MC region significantly exceeds the local Galactic background measured by AMS-02, strongly suggesting that the cloud is illuminated by particles accelerated by S147. These findings provide observational evidence for CR escape during the earlier evolutionary phases of this middle-aged SNR and highlight S147 as a promising candidate for detection at TeV energies by LHAASO.",

Phys. 147 (2023) 102794; arXiv:2205.05845). The authors concluded that two types of next-generation detectors are needed to answer these questions: high-accuracy instruments and detectors that maximize exposure at the highest energies. The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a proposed dual-satellite observatory, exemplifies the latter class and is designed to increase statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and to detect very-high-energy neutrinos following multi-messenger alerts. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) implements a compact, balloon-borne version of the POEMMA concept, adapted for a Super-Pressure Balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, with an expected campaign exceeding 20 days. PBR couples a wide field-of-view Schmidt telescope and a hybrid optical focal surface with a dedicated radio instrument to deliver simultaneous, complementary measurements of extensive air showers. The mission will validate the fluorescence detection strategy from space and raise technology readiness for a POEMMA-like space mission by observing UHECR-induced fluorescence light from suborbital altitudes, obtaining the first simultaneous optical Cherenkov and radio observations of high-altitude horizontal air showers above the cosmic-ray knee (E>3PeV), enabling energy-spectrum and composition studies at the PeV scale, and performing follow-ups of multi-messenger alerts to search for very-high-energy neutrinos via upward-going air showers. This paper summarizes the PBR payload and its expected performance.",

High inclination, dipping, neutron star Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) provide an excellent testbed to study the launching mechanism of such winds due to being persistently accreting and showing a nearly ubiquitous presence of highly-ionised plasmas. We aim to establish or rule out the presence of a wind in the high inclination LMXB 4U 1624-49, for which a highly ionised plasma has been repeatedly observed in X-ray spectra by Chandra and XMM-Newton, and a thermal-radiative pressure wind is expected. We leverage the exquisite spectral resolution of XRISM to perform phase-resolved spectroscopy of the full binary orbit to characterise the highly ionised plasma at all phases except during absorption dips. An outflow is clearly detected via phase-resolved spectroscopy of the source with XRISM/Resolve. Based on analysis of the radial velocity curve we determine an average velocity of ~200-320 km/s and a column density above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The line profiles are generally narrow, spanning from ~50 to ~100 km/s, depending on the orbital phase, pointing to a low velocity sheer or turbulence of the highly ionised outflow and a potential increase of turbulence as the absorption dip is approached, likely due to turbulent mixing. The line profiles, together with the derived launching radius and wind velocity are consistent with a wind being launched from the outskirts of the disc and without stratification, pointing to a thermal-radiative pressure origin.",

Working within Weyl geometry as a minimal realization of vectorial non-metricity, we formulate observable effects in a gauge-invariant manner and show that they are associated with path-dependent length transport governed by the Weyl field strength. We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain. As a result, the absence of deviations from General Relativity in current gravitational-wave observations already places meaningful and strong constraints on dynamical non-metric degrees of freedom.",

Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \\in \\{1, 1/2, 1/3\\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C.

Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity.

In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle.",

      "summary": "Gravitational lensing of gravitational wave (GW) will become the next frontier in studying cosmology and gravity. While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\\%$, $10\\%$ and $0.42\\%$ in the $\u039b$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$.

This paper studies the local coupling properties of the Starobinsky potential and KKLT potential by introducing a linear Lorentzian-type coupling, which locally breaks the slow roll conditions. We found that both positive and negative coupling can form a considerable abundance of PBH. Additionally, we also studied the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by this model.",

      "summary": "We present the cosmological analysis of the one-dimensional Lyman-$\u03b1$ flux power spectrum from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We capture the dependence of the signal on cosmology and intergalactic medium physics using an emulator trained on a cosmological suite of hydrodynamical simulations, and we correct its predictions for the impact of astrophysical contaminants and systematics, many of these not considered in previous analyses. We employ this framework to constrain the amplitude and logarithmic slope of the linear matter power spectrum at $k_\\star=0.009\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}s}$ and redshift $z=3$, obtaining $\u0394^2_\\star=0.379\\pm0.032$ and $n_\\star=-2.309\\pm0.019$. The robustness of these constraints is validated through the analysis of mocks and a large number of alternative data analysis variations, with cosmological parameters kept blinded throughout the validation process. We then combine our results with constraints from DESI BAO and temperature, polarization, and lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G to set constraints on $\u039b$CDM extensions. While our measurements do not significantly tighten the limits on the sum of neutrino masses from the combination of these probes, they sharpen the constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_\\mathrm{eff}=3.02\\pm0.10$, the running of the spectral index, $\u03b1_\\mathrm{s}=0.0014\\pm0.0041$, and the running of the running, $\u03b2_\\mathrm{s}=-0.0006\\pm0.0048$, by a factor of 1.18, 1.27, and 1.90, respectively. We conclude by outlining the improvements needed to fully reach the level of confidence implied by these uncertainties.",

      "summary": "Phantom divide line transitions are not possible in the context of single scalar field scalar-tensor theories. In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\\sim \u03bb\\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{16\u03c0G}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\\frac{G}\u03bb$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity. The feature of a phantom crossing in $f(\\mathcal{R},\u03c6)$ frameworks is new in the literature.",

In this work we investigate how the most general field theories in the context of general relativity can accomodate a phantom-to-quintessence transition which may be essential element of realistic Dark Energy scenarios in the late Universe. As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe. We also qualitatively compare the difficulties and fine-tunings required for $k$-essence theories to realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition, and how such a transition is naturally realized in modified gravity, without unnecessary fine-tunings and ghost eliminations.",

To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \\pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\u03b1= -1.23 \\pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\u03b1\\sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.",

      "summary": "In generalized Proca theories, characterized by a vector field with broken $U(1)$ gauge invariance, late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized with a dark energy equation of state in the regime $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$. In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\\rm DE} > -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\u03bc$ and $\u03a3$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\u03c8$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\u03c8$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\u03bc$ and $\u03a3$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations.",

      "summary": "The extragalactic background light (EBL) fluctuations in the optical/near-IR encode the cumulative integrated galaxy light (IGL), diffuse intra-halo light (IHL), and high-$z$ sources from the epoch of reionisation (EoR), but they are difficult to disentangle with auto-spectra alone. We aim to decompose the EBL into its principal constituents using multi-band intensity mapping combined with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering. We develop a joint halo-model framework in which IHL follows a mass- and redshift-dependent luminosity scaling, IGL is set by an evolving Schechter luminosity function, and EoR emission is modelled with Pop II/III stellar emissivities and a binned star-formation efficiency. Using mock surveys in a flat $\u039b$CDM cosmology with ten spectral bands spanning 0.75-5.0$\\rm \u03bcm$ in the NEP deep fields over about 100$\u00b0^2$ with source detections down to AB=20.5 for masking, and six redshift bins to $z=2.5$, we fit auto- and cross-power spectra using a MCMC method. The combined SPHEREx$\\times$Euclid analysis recovers all fiducial parameters within 1$\u03c3$ and reduces 1$\u03c3$ uncertainties on IHL parameters by 10-35% relative to SPHEREx EBL-only, while EoR star-formation efficiency parameters improve by 20-35%. Cross-correlations reveal a stronger coupling of IHL than IGL to the shear field, enhancing component separation; conversely, the EoR contribution shows negligible correlation with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, aiding its isolation in the EBL. Relative to the SPHEREx EBL-only case, the inferred IHL fraction as a function of halo mass is significantly tightened over $10^{11}-10^{14} M_{\\odot}$, with uncertainties reduced by 5-30%, and the resulting star-formation rate density constraints extend to $z\\sim 11$, with uncertainty reductions of 22-31%.",

      "summary": "We investigate the hypothesis that the evolution of the Universe can be described by a single dark fluid whose effective equation of state (EoS), $\u03c9_{\\rm{eff}}$, is a linear combination of a logarithmic term and a power law term, both involving the Lambert $W$ function. This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 1.2~\\text{km\\,s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\\pm 2.5$~Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $\u039b$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Finally, we assess the observational viability of the model using information criteria, particularly the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and compare these results with those obtained for the $\u039b$CDM model, which serves as our reference.",

      "summary": "Many early universe scenarios predict post-inflationary tensor perturbations from causality-limited, sub-horizon sources. While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \\propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \\sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.",

We report the first-ever constraints on such sources based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization measurements. Using data from BICEP/Keck, SPTpol, SPT-3G, Planck, and WMAP, we constrain the amplitude of an early causal tensor (ECT) power spectrum parameterized by $r_{ect}$, the ratio of causal tensor power to total scalar power at $k~=~0.01$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and obtain a 95% CL upper limit of $r_{ect}<$ 0.0077. Since $r_{ect}$ can easily be related to the parameters of a given theory, our bound robustly constrains a broad class of well-motivated gravitational wave sources in the early universe, including first-order cosmological phase transitions, enhanced small-scale density perturbations, and various topological defects. Finally, we translate our limit into a bound on the present-day energy density in gravitational waves at ultra-low frequencies otherwise inaccessible to traditional gravitational wave detection strategies, including pulsar timing arrays, interferometers, and resonant cavities.",

      "summary": "Accurate modelling of redshift-space distortions (RSD) is essential for maximizing the cosmological information extracted from large galaxy redshift surveys. In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$\u03b1$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $\u03c9_{\\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A_{\\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \\leq z \\leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k_{max} \\lesssim 0.35 h\\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k_{max} \\gtrsim 0.30 h\\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k_{max} \\gtrsim 0.25 h\\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$\u03b1$ samples. Among the full perturbation theory-based models, the enhanced treatment of small-scale RSD effects in ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ improves cosmological parameter constraints by up to a factor of two.",

Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| < 30\u00b0, |b| < 20\u00b0) as filled by Biteau using \"cloning\". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where \"galaxies\" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog.",

Various experiments are designed to search for the axion, however no confirmative signal has been observed. On the other hand, there are also hypothetical heavy particles in axion models, such as the heavy scalar $s$, which is the CP-even component of the complex scalar that carries $U(1)_{PQ}$ charge, and the vector-like heavy quark (VLQ) in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov~(KSVZ) axion model. Studying signals induced by them are helpful for axion searches. In this paper, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung energy spectrum arising from the decay of the heavy scalar or VLQ in the KSVZ model. The result shows that these heavy particles can emit ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), with the peak frequency depending on the model's parameter inputs. In addition, the graviton spectrum is distinguished from the thermal GW background at high frequencies if there is an early matter-dominated era induced by these heavy particles. Future measurements of ultrahigh-frequency GWs may provide indirect evidence for the KSVZ axion.",

We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.",

While the positive $\u039b$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $\u039b$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case.",

      "summary": "We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour--Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.",

As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\\dot\u03c6^2=\u03b2(\u03c6)V(\u03c6)$, where $\u03b2(\u03c6)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data.",

Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-\u03b1r^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$.

We update the Union3+UNITY1.5 SN cosmology analysis in light of increasing evidence for at least two core populations of SNe Ia and apply this \"UNITY1.8\" model to the updated \"Union3.1\" compilation (Hoyt et al. 2026). In addition to finding evidence for two different light-curve-shape (x1) distributions, we also find that the color distributions are different, that the light-curve-shape/magnitude standardization relations are different, and that these populations have different distributions across host-galaxy stellar mass and redshift. Importantly, we find that the residual host-mass luminosity step found in prior SN Ia cosmology analyses is now consistent with zero for unreddened SNe. We report a significantly tightened constraint on the split in the red-color standardization between SNe in low- and high-mass galaxies. We find that the estimated uncertainties shrink on cosmological parameters when fitting the same SNe assuming two modes versus one mode. We confirm similar trends in simulated data when running both versions of UNITY on the same (two-mode) simulations. For a flat LambdaCDM cosmology, we find Om = 0.334+0.025-0.024 from SNe alone; for a flat w0-wa cosmology, we find w0 = -0.760+0.084-0.082 and wa = -0.79+0.28-0.30 when including SNe, BAO, and CMB.

The matter horizon was first identified by Ellis and Stoeger in 2010 as a dynamical causal boundary that encloses a sub-region of spacetime where structure formation actually takes place. We construct a multi-scale hierarchical framework for the propagation of geodesic congruences that avoids the shell-crossing singularity by cutting the spacetime at the matter horizon and glueing to another spacetime with opposite orientation. We identify a relationship between the multi-scale hierarchical framework and the cosmological zoom-in N-body simulation approach, and relate the local sub-region that decouples from the Hubble flow to the region of interest in cosmological zoom-in N-body simulations. Most importantly, the multi-scale hierarchical framework provides a more robust way of implementing boundary conditions, which could benefit cosmological zoom-in N-body simulation approaches.",

In this paper, we demonstrate how the noise complexity -- often deemed \"erasing the signal\" -- induced by a particular de-projection technique, the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform arXiv:1312.0430, can be used to extract the BAO signal and non-gaussian aperture-mass-like properties at chosen physical scales. We take into account parts of the data vectors that should effectively be without cosmological signature and also introduce an additional re-weighting designed to specifically highlight clustering features -- both at the probe (summary statistics) or map (amplitude of the field) level. We thus demonstrate why weak-gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure of the Universe, though only in a tomographic setting, does not erase scale and time-dependent features of the dynamics of matter, while providing a tool to effectively extract them from actual galaxy-shapes measurements.",

Chief among these are the Hubble tension and the apparent dynamical nature of dark energy as inferred from the recent DESI DR2 analysis. In this work, we analyze a field-theoretic description of cosmology where both dark energy and dark matter are interacting spin zero fields. We give a thorough study of a wide range of the interaction strength and demonstrate the effect on the dark energy equation of state and the Hubble tension. Using the recent cosmological data, we extract constraints on cosmological parameters including the free parameters of the model.",

      "summary": "We discuss key aspects of the nature of radiation from global strings and its impact on the relic axion density. Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a ``hard'' spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a ``soft spectrum'' from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\\rm a}\\approx 160\\,\u03bc{\\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\\approx 38\\,{\\rm GHz}$. If axions are emitted directly by the string network, and we use emission spectra reported in field theory simulations, then $m_{\\rm a}\\approx 4\\,\u03bc{\\rm eV}$ and $f\\approx 1\\,{\\rm GHz}$, however this increases to $m_a \\approx 125\\,\u03bc{\\rm eV}$ and $f\\approx 30\\,{\\rm GHz}$ using our spectra for the case of an oscillating string. In all scenarios there are significant remaining uncertainties that we delineate.",

      "summary": "The determination of distances using time-series photometry of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) relies on a ~5% empirical correction related to the properties of their host galaxies, e.g., global stellar mass. It is therefore crucial for unbiased cosmology inference that host galaxy properties be self-consistently determined across the full range of redshifts probed, which we undertake in this study for approximately 2000 SNe in the Union3 compilation (now Union3.1). We use aperture-matched, homogeneously-reduced, optical-infrared photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to derive global galaxy properties using the stellar population synthesis and SED-fitting code Prospector. We find that the host masses of $z<0.10$ SNe in Union3 were, on average, overestimated relative to the rest of the sample, while the opposite was true for $z<0.15$ SNe in Pantheon+. After correction, the two studies' average distance modulus estimated for low-redshift SNe, previously $>0.03$ mag discrepant, come into 0.01 mag agreement. We then update the UNITY SN analysis and find that the uncertainties on all standardization parameters shrink to 0.6-0.9x their previous sizes. For flat-$\u039b$CDM, we find $\u03a9_m=0.344^{+0.026}_{-0.025}$, a -0.3$\u03c3$ shift from Union3. We then combine with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) exactly as done by DESI DR2 and find $w_0=-0.719\\pm0.084$, $w_a=-0.95^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$, corresponding to 3.4$\u03c3$ evidence against a cosmological constant (down from 3.8$\u03c3$). We also update the DESI combined probe analysis using our correction to Pantheon+ and the recent DES-SN5YR Dovekie recalibration, finding $3.2\u03c3$ (up from 2.8$\u03c3$) and 3.4$\u03c3$ (down from 4.2$\u03c3$) evidence against a cosmological constant in the $w_0w_a$ plane, altogether marking a significantly improved consistency across SN analyses.",

Under a general formalism, we determine the effective potential and the coupling function associated with the Gauss-Bonnet term as functions of the cosmological parameters $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$, respectively. To implement the reconstruction methodology for the background variables, we study an example in which the attractors for the index $n_s$ and the ratio $r$ are in agreement with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. In this context, explicit expressions for the effective potential $V(\u03c6)$ and the coupling parameter $\u03be(\u03c6)$ are reconstructed. Moreover, the reconstruction based on observational parameters shows that $V(\u03c6)\\not\\propto 1/\u03be(\u03c6)$, in contrast to the assumption adopted in the literature for the study of the evolution of the universe in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.",

The XPT geometry is obtained by combining a large strike point radius, similar to the Super-X divertor (SXD), with an additional X-point near the separatrix in the baffled outer divertor chambers and leads to additional exhaust benefits over the SXD. The broader electron density profile near the secondary X-point leads to additional plasma-neutral interactions, evidenced by a broader hydrogenic emission profile, and resulting in larger power and ion sinks. The increase in plasma-neutral interactions also leads to lower target electron temperatures and heat fluxes. These benefits appear to extend to transients, and preliminary evidence of improved ELM buffering in the XPT is presented. These results showcase how multiple alternative divertor configuration strategies can be combined to improve momentum, power, and particle losses, which may be required for the challenging exhaust conditions of future reactors.",

We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfv\u00e9n wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology.",

Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.",

At magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales, compressible turbulence is damped by transit-time damping, naturally generating suprathermal electrons and proton beams. As the energy cascade reaches sub-ion scales, multiple branches of ion Bernstein waves are excited and contribute to the formation of proton suprathermal tails. Under realistic conditions such as those in the solar wind, these processes remain efficient and provide a natural explanation for the super-Alfv\u00e9nic proton beams observed in situ. We show that compressive fluctuations, though often understudied, are essential for cross-scale energy transfer and dissipation in collisionless plasma turbulence.",

      "summary": "In non-equilibrium plasmas where the vibrational temperature exceeds the gas temperature, conventional harmonic models underestimate superelastic electron heating rates by an order of magnitude or more. This failure stems from the artificial decoupling of energy modes, which ignores the exponential heating contributions from overpopulated high-lying states characteristic of Treanor-Gordiets distributions. We resolve this limitation by deriving a closed-form, thermodynamically consistent anharmonic gain function based on detailed balance and a second-order Dunham expansion. This formulation serves as a unified governing equation that naturally identifies the kinetic crossover between vibrational-vibrational (V-V) up-pumping and vibrational-translational (V-T) relaxation. This approach accurately predicts the Treanor minimum and recovers the accuracy of full state-to-state benchmarks at a fraction of the computational cost. The model provides a robust closure for predicting electron temperature evolution in applications ranging from hypersonic flows to plasma-assisted combustion.",

By coupling to the plasma vorticity, the scattering generates a cross-polarized signal proportional to the turbulent vorticity, effectively acting as a calorimeter for shear flows. We identify a diffractive scattering signature analogous to ``Debye-Scherrer ring'' that reveals the eddy size distribution.

      "summary": "The magnetic compression experiment at General Fusion was a repetitive non-destructive test to study plasma physics applicable to magnetic target fusion compression. A compact torus (CT) is formed with a co-axial gun into a containment region with an hour-glass shaped inner flux conserver, and an insulating outer wall. External coil currents keep the CT off the outer wall (radial levitation) and then rapidly compress it inwards. The optimal external coil configuration greatly improved both the levitated CT lifetime and the recurrence rate of shots with good compressional flux conservation. As confirmed by spectrometer data, the improved levitation field profile reduced plasma impurity levels by suppressing the interaction between plasma and the insulating outer wall during the formation process. Significant increases in magnetic field, electron density, and ion temperature were routinely observed at magnetic compression in the final external coil configuration tested, despite the prevalence of an instability, thought be an external kink mode, at compression. Matching the decay rate of the levitation currents to that of the CT currents resulted in a reduced level of MHD activity associated with unintentional compression by the levitation field, and a higher probability of long-lived CTs. The DELiTE (Differential Equations on Linear Triangular Elements) framework was developed for spatial discretisation of partial differential equations on an unstructured triangular grid in axisymmetric geometry. The framework is based on discrete differential operators in matrix form, which are derived using linear finite elements and mimic some of the properties of their continuous counterparts. A single-fluid two-temperature MHD model is implemented in this framework.",

In recent DIII-D experiments, external magnetic perturbations were used to rotate and periodically bifurcate the island on the q = 2 surface, causing a switchback between a q = 2/1-dominated structure and a narrower q = 4/2-dominated structure. To investigate how this topological change affects electron transport, we employ the field line tracing code TRIP3D with an implemented collisional operator. Thermal, tracer electrons launched from O-points, X-points, and outside separatrix boundaries reveal distinct diffusion regimes, including classical, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive behavior, depending on both the dominant island mode and launch location. These results suggest that island bifurcation can alter electron diffusion across rational surfaces, with direct implications for particle confinement. While the present work emphasizes diffusion as a general framework, the findings provide insight into the conditions under which electron trapping into an island or stochastization of the island's separatrix can enable additional mechanisms, such as the generation of energetic electrons.",

Understanding how, in the absence of Coulomb collisions, energy is redistributed between the different plasma species remains a fundamental open question. We use 3D fully-kinetic simulations to investigate energy partition in weakly magnetized counter-propagating plasmas. Our results reveal a complex interplay between different processes, where at early times the Weibel instability drives a first stage of magnetic field amplification and at late times the kinking of current filaments drives a second amplification stage via a dynamo-type mechanism. Electrons are heated primarily during the latter phase through magnetic pumping. By the time the flows thermalize, we observe that the final temperature ratio $T_e/T_i$ and energy partition depend on the ion-to-electron mass ratio. For electron-proton flows, the electron thermal energy only reaches up to a few percent of the initial ion kinetic energy.",

Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs) in magnetar magnetospheres, we find that the scattering--although suppressed by the magnetic field--inevitably enters the linear growth stage. The subsequent evolution bifurcates: full scattering occurs when the density exceeds a critical value, whereas below it the scattering saturates and the FRB can escape. This eases the tension with observations of compact emission regions and may explain the observed diversity, including the presence or absence of FRBs associated with X-ray bursts.",

      "summary": "Energetic particles interact with the plasma surrounding them, resonating with certain plasma waves to stabilize them while destabilizing others, and changing the character of the background turbulence in ways that have not been fully quantified or understood. Interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions. This is a process that would ideally be described by a kinetic model, a type of model that follows a probability distribution function (PDF) for all particles in 7-dimensional space. Because of the high dimensionality of a kinetic model, such simulations use the largest computational resources available, and are yet unable to simulate a realistic number of particles, reach the large scales necessary for astrophysical problems, or use high-precision numerical methods. Two available alternatives to kinetic plasma models have been explored: a multi-fluid model, and a hybrid fluid/Fokker-Planck model. These methods are hampered by the physical modeling of the coupling. We develop a new model, which follows the PDF for all particles; this can be viewed as a step toward physical realism above a multi-fluid MHD model, while also being more computationally efficient than a kinetic model. The equations we develop model both the background plasma and the energetic particles self-consistently. Over the last decade, similar PDF methods have been developed to a high level of sophistication to model reactive flows and turbulent combustion for engineering applications. For treatment of the feedback of the energetic particles on a background plasma, a PDF closure approach should evaluate the mean characteristics, including the density, with better statistical quality than will particle-sampling procedures.",

They arise from the geometry of the space describing the properties of multi-component wave fields. An important example for electromagnetic waves is the spin-redirection Berry phase associated with the evolution of the spin direction. Because this effect has traditionally been studied in isotropic media where the spin is aligned with the ray trajectory, it has become commonly assumed that this spin-redirection Berry phase requires nonplanar rays. Here we show that a spin-redirection phase can in fact arise along a planar ray if the spin evolves along the ray. We expose this effect through the singular example of a moving unmagnetized plasma, and demonstrate how this behavior can more generally arise from a finite transverse spin. In identifying this new spin-redirection mechanism our work not only provides the tools to discover additional manifestations of SOIs in nature, but also uncovers supplemental degrees of freedom to harness SOIs to control light.",

The decay process is definitively identified through multiple lines of evidence: satisfaction of frequency and wavevector resonance conditions, strong phase coherence and temporal coincidence between the interacting waves, exclusion of competing mechanisms, and full agreement with theoretical predictions. Particle-in-cell simulations, conducted under close beam-plasma conditions, successfully reproduce the key features of the observations. Notably, they suggest that the wave packet observed by Solar Orbiter may be trapped within an extended, nearly flat-bottomed density well, where the decay process is not overcome by wave scattering on random density fluctuations and subsequent mode conversion effects.",

Simulations with different ion-to-electron mass ratios are set up to investigate the role of electron scales in the formation of intermittent structures. We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence. This study reveals the nature of sub-ion-scale current sheets in KAW turbulence and their role in dissipation.",

      "summary": "The decay of magnetically dominated turbulence exhibits robust inverse transfer of magnetic energy even in the absence of net magnetic helicity, challenging traditional cascade-based phenomenology. While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas.",

The plasma exhibited a bright emission that persisted for up to 30--40 us after breakdown, followed by a very weak glow lasting up to 19 ms. Peak electron number density of about 2 x 10^17 cm-3 and electron temperature of about 7 eV were measured. Excellent agreement between both techniques was obtained for absolute electron number densities.

Two hybrid CR models are developed for helium, lithium, and beryllium, retaining detailed fine-structure states up to selected principal quantum numbers, while higher-lying states are statistically averaged to form superconfigurations. These models are applied to compute radiative power loss, as well as average and effective charge states, across a wide range of electron temperatures and densities.

      "summary": "Understanding electron energy dynamics in low-temperature plasmas such as capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs), including energy absorption, conversion, transport, and dissipation, is essential for interpreting discharge physics and process applications. We propose a kinetic-moment framework based on particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulations. The framework reconstructs the first three velocity moments of the Boltzmann equation directly from PIC/MCC data and enables a quantitative, self-consistent description of electron energy dynamics in low-pressure CCPs. To clarify energy conversion among electromagnetic energy, electron fluid kinetic (mechanical) energy, and electron thermal (internal) energy, we further separate the total energy transport equation into kinetic- and thermal-energy equations. We find that, at low pressure, electrons gain directed kinetic energy in the sheath and convert it locally into thermal energy through pressure-strain interaction and collisions. Thermal energy is then transported into the bulk and is dissipated mainly by inelastic electron-neutral collisions. We further decompose pressure-strain interaction into reversible pressure dilatation and irreversible viscous-like dissipation, which correspond to conversion driven by volumetric compression or expansion and by shear deformation, respectively. This decomposition reveals a significant thermalization channel beyond collisions. More broadly, the results show coexistence of localized kinetic-to-thermal conversion near the sheath and nonlocal energy transport from the sheath to the bulk dominated by microscopic heat flux. The heat flux deviates strongly from Fourier's law based on local temperature gradients. This framework provides a clear fluid description with kinetic fidelity and offers a practical tool for analyzing energy evolution in nonequilibrium plasmas.",

      "summary": "To achieve a high energy gain, the fusion reactor plasma must reach a very high density. However, the tokamak plasmas ofen undergo disruption when the density exceeds the Greenwald density. The density limit disruption in tokamak plasmas is a mysterious barrier to magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, and hitherto, is still an unresolved issue. Over the past several years, the high density experiments with Greenwald density ratio $n_e/n_{eG}\\sim1$ has been carried out using the conventional gas-puff fuelling method in HL-2A NBI and Ohmically heated plasmas. It is found for the first time that there are multiple-branch MHD instabilities in the core plasmas while $n_e/n_{eG}>0.85$. The simulation analysis suggests that the core-localized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) activities belong to Alfv${\u00e9}$nic ion temperature gradient (AITG) modes, and on experiment firstly, it is discovered that they trigger the minor or major disruption of bulk plasmas while the density is peaked. These new findings are of great importance to figure out and understand the origin of density limit disruptions, as well as to forecast and avoid them for future fusion rectors.",

      "summary": "Turbulent transport remains one of the principal obstacles to achieving efficient magnetic confinement in fusion devices. Two of the dominant drivers of the turbulence are microscale instabilities fuelled by electron- and ion-temperature gradients (ETG and ITG), whose nonlinear saturation determines the cross-field transport of particles and energy. Despite decades of study, predictive modelling of this turbulence has been limited either to expensive gyrokinetic simulations or to reduced models calibrated by fitting to numerical or experimental data, restricting their utility for reactor design. Here we present a simple asymptotic scaling theory that unifies ETG- and ITG-driven turbulence within a common framework. By balancing the fundamental time scales of linear growth, nonlinear decorrelation, and parallel propagation, the theory isolates the dependence of the heat flux on equilibrium parameters to two key quantities: the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio. We show that these quantities encapsulate the essential physics of saturation, leading to distinct predictions for ETG and ITG transport: a cubic scaling with the temperature gradient in the electron channel, and a linear scaling in the ion channel. Extensive nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm that these theoretical predictions hold irrespective of the magnetic geometry (slab, tokamak, or stellarator), including the first numerical confirmation of the cubic ETG scaling anticipated by earlier theory. By isolating the dependence on just the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio, our framework provides a physics-based foundation for fast, geometry-aware transport models, offering a pathway toward reactor optimisation in both tokamaks and stellarators.",

In this configuration, electrons are first accelerated inside an underdense plasma by a relativistic laser pulse and subsequently interact with the reflected laser field, emitting high-energy photons via nonlinear Compton scattering which decay into electron-positron pairs through the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. Using analytical scalings supported by quasi-3D particle-in-cell simulations including QED effects, we demonstrate that a laser pulse with power as low as 2 PW is sufficient to reach the quantum regime characterized by $\u03c7_e> 1$ . For higher powers, we observe a rapid nonlinear increase in the number of generated positrons, reaching more than 2 nC for a 10 PW laser pulse with energy of approximately 1.1 kJ. A semi-analytical model is employed to estimate the positron yield, showing good agreement with simulation results. We further study the influence of laser depletion and the positioning of the reflecting foil on the efficiency of pair production. The presented scheme provides an experimentally feasible platform for probing strong-field QED effects using currently available multi-petawatt laser systems.",

This concept extends the traditional notion of omnigenity, the theoretical principle upon which most of existing magnetic fusion reactor designs, including tokamaks, are based. While piecewise omnigenity broadens the range of potentially viable stellarator reactor candidates, it is achieved by relaxing the requirement of continuity in the magnetic field strength, which could appear to pose significant challenges for the design of magnetohydrodynamic equilibria. In this work, a stellarator magnetic configuration is presented that satisfies the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium equation and that achieves unprecedented levels of piecewise omnigenity. As a result, it exhibits favorable transport characteristics, including reduced bulk radial (neoclassical and turbulent transport), bootstrap current and fast ion losses. In addition, the configuration displays robust MHD stability across a range of \\b{eta} values and possesses a rotational transform profile compatible with an island divertor. Collectively, these features satisfy the standard set of physics criteria required for a viable reactor candidate which, until now, were believed to be attainable only by certain types of omnigenous stellarators.",

Time-dependent simulations reveal a two-phase transition mechanism: the high-field-side radiation front first extends across the last closed flux surface and stabilizes above the X-point, causing local $T_e$ to drop from $\\sim 70\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ to $\\sim 10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and inducing $E\\times B$ flow reversal in a thin layer below the X-point, which lasts $< 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$; Flow reversal below the X-point subsequently triggers the sharp drop in outer target temperature on a timescale of $1-2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, establishing deep detachment a few ms thereafter. A bifurcation transition occurs when the high-field-side radiation front crosses the separatrix while the outer divertor remains attached, with the $T_e$ cliff manifesting distinctly when the outer target $T_e \\gtrsim 10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ prior to the bifurcation. These results demonstrate that the bifurcation is linked to in-out divertor asymmetry and asymmetric radiation front evolution.",

Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting. By relying only on measured scattering parameters, this gradient-free approach is robust to experimental drift and noise and does not require complex full-wave models. Significant performance improvements over traditional simulation-based (in-silico) inverse design are demonstrated, with in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x higher isolation between ports than the best in-silico design at the same target frequency. This work also presents guidelines for applying Bayesian optimization to noisy, high-dimensional physical systems.",

Using the STRIPE modeling framework-which integrates SOLPS-ITER, COMSOL, RustBCA, and GITR/GITRm-we simulate carbon erosion, re-deposition, and global impurity transport in two H-mode discharges with varying antenna--plasma gaps and RF powers. COMSOL predicts rectified sheath potentials of 1-5 kV, localized near the bottom of the antenna where magnetic field lines intersect at grazing angles. Erosion is dominated by carbon self-sputtering, with RF-accelerated D+ ions contributing up to 1 % of the total erosion flux. GITRm simulations show that in the small-gap case, only ~ 13 % of eroded carbon is re-deposited locally, with 58 % transported into the core. In contrast, the large-gap case exhibits lower total erosion, along with reduced core penetration (~ 35 %) and weaker re-deposition (~ 4 %), consistent with lower collisionality and limited plasma contact. The simulation trends are consistent with experimental observations, which have not shown elevated core impurity levels during helicon operation in the present graphite-wall configuration. However, under certain plasma conditions and magnetic configurations, the helicon antenna may still act as a finite source of net erosion and core-directed impurity transport, potentially influencing the overall core impurity balance. These findings emphasize the need for sheath-aware antenna designs and predictive impurity transport modeling to support future high-power RF systems with high-Z first wall materials in fusion devices.",

Despite their attractive properties, QP fields are not amenable to the near-axis expansion, a major theoretical tool for understanding toroidal fields. In this paper, we provide a novel framework for defining and understanding QP flux surfaces. This framework relies on a simplification that transforms the task of finding a quasi-poloidal flux surface from a 3D problem to a 2D problem. This simplification also applies to asymmetric magnetic mirrors with desirable properties. We sketch how this 2D problem can form the basis of an efficient optimisation problem for finding QP flux surfaces. We leverage this 2D problem for theoretical understanding: for instance, we identify one class of QP flux surfaces that are naturally flat mirrors (Velasco et al. 2023). The reduced model is validated against numerically optimised QP equilibria. We further utilise the reduced model to explain the prevalence of cusps, high mirror ratios, and narrow pinch points in these numerical equilibria.",

Applying this formalism to two benchmark geometries - single density steps (wires) and periodic gratings -- we obtain analytic estimates. For gratings, finite coherence simultaneously lowers Bragg-peak heights and broadens their widths, whereas for isolated steps only the overall scaling with q affected. We map the parameter space relevant to current SASE and self-seeded XFELs, revealing that Doppler effects remain managable for the trieval of geometry parameters (less than few 10 % error) for SASE bandwidths but become the dominant error source in seeded configurations or above-keV temperatures. Practical consequences for density-gradient retrieval and interface-sharpness measurements are quantified. The results supply clear criteria for when Doppler broadening must be included in SAXS data analysis and offer a route to infer electron temperature directly from coherence-loss signatures.",

However, the temporal variation of the parameter $\u03ba$, which quantifies the presence of suprathermal particles, is not fully captured by such a QL analysis, and typically $\u03ba$ remains constant during plasma dynamics. We propose a new QL modeling that goes beyond the limits of a previous approach, realistically assuming that the quasithermal core cannot evolve independently of energetic suprathermals. The case study is done on the electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability generated by anisotropic bi-Kappa electrons with $A=T_\\perp/T_\\parallel > 1$ ($\\parallel, \\perp$ denoting directions with respect to the background magnetic field). The parameter $\u03ba$ self-consistently varies through the QL equation of kurtosis (fourth-order moment) coupled with temporal variations of the temperature components, relaxing the constraint on the independence of the low-energy (core) electrons and suprathermal high-energy tails of VDs. The results refine and extend previous approaches. A clear distinction is made between regimes that lead to a decrease or an increase in the $\u03ba$ parameter with saturation of the instability. What predominates is a decrease in $\u03ba$, i.e., an excess of suprathermalization, which energizes suprathermal electrons due to self-generated wave fluctuations. Additionally, we found that VDs can evolve toward a quasi-Maxwellian shape (as $\u03ba$ increases) primarily in regimes with low beta and initial kappa values greater than five. Instability-driven relaxation only partially resolves temperature anisotropy in bi-Kappa electron VDs, as wave fluctuations generally act to further energize suprathermal electrons.",

We also introduce a more general integro-differentiable operator formulation to probe relevant terms in the collision operator. To validate the proposed methodology we use data generated by self-consistent electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell simulations. We show that both approaches recover operators that can accurately reproduce the plasma phase space dynamics while being more accurate than estimates based on particle track statistics. These results further demonstrate the potential of using differentiable simulators to infer collision operators for scenarios where no closed form solution exists or deviations from existing theory are expected.",

The absolute atom densities and translational temperatures were determined over a range of pressures and RF power . At pressures of 267 Pa and above, the O atom mole fraction increases with RF power and decreases with pressure, reaching a maximum of 15 percent. However, at 133 and 67 Pa it passes through a distinct maximum with power before decreasing significantly. The atom recombination processes are probed by time resolved measurements in the afterglow of pulse modulated plasmas. At 133 and 67 Pa the atom loss is dominated by surface recombination, and we see clear evidence that this rate is increased by energetic ion bombardment, in agreement with a study from Bill Graham group. This effect partially explains the observed decrease in dissociation at high RF power. The time-resolved results also allow the O negative ion density to be determined and indicate the creation of ozone in the afterglow. At 133 Pa, the trends with RF power of the O2 dissociation, O negative ion density and gas temperature suggest a transition at high power to a plasma mode with fewer high energy electrons. At higher pressures gas phase recombination mechanisms become dominant, however gas convection driven by gas cooling in the afterglow makes it complex to analyse the time-resolved data.",

      "summary": "Comet C/2023 P1 (Nishimura) was observed by the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI), onboard the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, from 2023 September 1 to 14. During this period, the ion tail of the comet exhibited continual fluctuations and four tail disconnection events (TDEs), each coinciding with the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this work, we report on the ion tail dynamics of the best observed TDE, which occurred on September 11. The SoloHI white-light images reveal an abrupt bending, subsequent kinks, and severing of a downstream portion of the pre-existing ion tail. The onset of disconnection occurred $\\sim$6.5 hours after the projected passage of the CME leading edge in the images, consistent with a CME flank encounter. After the disconnection, the ion tail reformed within $\\sim$24 hours, with a regrowth rate of $\\sim$86$\\pm7~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, indicating the rate at which newly ionized material forms along the magnetic field draped around the comet's coma. After the TDE, the detached tail drifted anti-sunward at an estimated speed of $\\sim$295$\\pm20~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, comparable to the local CME flank's speed, suggesting that the severed plasma was most likely carried away from the comet by the CME. This study provides the first direct, quantitative characterization of comet-CME interactions and the subsequent regrowth phase of a cometary TDE. These measurements were achievable by SoloHI's unique inner-heliospheric coverage, thanks to a combination of high photometric sensitivity, short exposure times, and a wide field of view that preserves the fine-scale tail dynamics.",

The two 3He-rich SEP events, originating from active region (AR) 13615, exhibit two key anomalies: (1) sunward streaming SEPs and (2) SEP travel path lengths exceeding 2 - 8 times the nominal Parker spiral expectations. Remote observations suggest these SEPs have been redirected by a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) that also originated from AR 13615 two days prior on March 30, 2024 at 21:04 UT. Using the near-Sun CME speed and width measurements, we estimate its size and location at the onset time of the first 3He-rich SEP event. Based on our estimates, SEPs propagating around the ICME front have travelled between 0.76 - 0.95 AU when they arrive at SO, increasing to 0.94 - 1.1 AU at PSP, consistent with our observed SEP arrival times. These findings constitute the first multi-spacecraft observation of sunward streaming 3He-rich SEPs. We discuss the implications of this phenomenon on 3He-rich seed material and the rare widespread 3He-rich SEP events (see Section 5.4).",

The persistence of $1/f$ spectrum is further illustrated with decade-long {\\it in situ} magnetic field measurements from the ACE spacecraft. Together, these results help explain the ubiquity of $1/f$ noise under the unavoidable superposition inherent in long-duration heliospheric data.",

Here we present four TFs with a different kind of structure appearing at one of their edges. Two of them, observed by the Cluster mission, are bounded by a hot flow anomaly (HFA). In one case, the HFA was observed only by the spacecraft closest to the bow shock, while the other three probes observed an FCB. In addition, two other TFs were observed by the MMS spacecraft to be delimited by a structure that we call HFA-like FCB. In the spacecraft data, these structures present signatures similar to those of HFAs: dips in magnetic field magnitude and solar wind density, decelerated and deflected plasma flow and increased temperature. However, a detailed inspection of these events reveals the absence of heating of the SW beam. Instead, the beam almost disappears inside these events and the plasma moments are strongly influenced by the suprathermal particles. We suggest that HFA-like FCBs are related to the evolution and structure of the directional discontinuities of the interplanetary magnetic field whose thickness is larger than the gyroradious of suprathermal ions. We also show that individual TFs may appear together with several different types of transient upstream mesoscale structures, which brings up a question about their combined effect on regions downstream of the bow shock.",

We present the methods for calculating density gradients over different window sizes, rate of change of density index, power spectral density and the spectral slope at both low and high latitudes. The faceplate plasma data are not continuously available through the years. However, about 8 years of data from Swarm A are processed from late 2014 to the end of 2025. Some statistical results from Swarm A are presented. The variations of plasma structures and irregularities are dependent on solar activity, season, local time and geomagnetic activities, and the variations show different patterns between low and high latitudes. For example, the high-latitude ionosphere is characterized by persistent ionospheric structures and irregularities poleward of 60 magnetic latitude, while the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities are only dominant during 19-01 local time near the magnetic equator. The occurrence of steep spectral slope at high latitudes shows clear seasonal variations, i.e., it maximizes during local summer and minimizes during local winter in both hemispheres. However, the occurrence of steep spectral slope at low latitudes is only sensible when significant plasma structures and irregularities are present. We further calculate the histogram of spectral slopes at low latitudes when the rate of change of density index is enhanced. The histogram resembles a Gaussian distribution with an expected value of 1.97. The processed data are available to the wider community. Given the high resolution, this new data product will be useful for the scientific communities that are interested in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and near-Earth space environment.",

We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.",

While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\u03b7\\propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the \"frozen-in\" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.",

Our results highlight how streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence: for nearly-incompressible fluctuations the energy is primarily transferred to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, while is back-transferred towards larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations, on the contrary, do not show a clear topological selection of the energy transfer since the overall direction of the local cascade rate is found to be determined by the sign of $-\\nabla\\cdot u$ (plasma volumetric compression or expansion).",

Here we propose a simple method to calculate the same using the in-situ data of multi-spacecraft systems. Unlike the popular Curlometer method which depends on the vector integration theorems, our integration-free method is based on the construction of a local orthonormal coordinate system and the associated finite difference approximations. The Curlometer is applicable to a four spacecraft system arranged in a tetrahedron and yields a single volume-averaged estimate of the curl. Using our proposed method over 107 intervals of MMS (NASA) data, on the other hand, we successfully calculate the spatial derivatives at the position of each spacecraft of the tetrahedron and a three-spacecraft (non-collinear) subset of the same. The average value of all the curls calculated for a given tetrahedron shows an excellent agreement (correlation coeffcient ~ 0:99) with the curls calculated using Curlometer formula. The quality of the calculated curl (using our method) is found to improve if the spacecraft configuration approaches a regular tetrahedron. The current framework facilitates investigation of turbulent heating rates and the exploration of local flow features like Beltramization, existence of current sheets, etc., in present and future multi-spacecraft mission, including those involving more than four spacecraft.",

To address this shortcoming, we develop a \"4pi\" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a \"visibility\" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far (\"invisible\" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or \"missed\" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources.",

      "summary": "Magnetic switchbacks are fluctuations in the solar wind in which the interplanetary magnetic field sharply deflects away from its background direction so as to create folds in magnetic field lines while remaining of roughly constant magnitude. The magnetic field and velocity fluctuations are extremely well correlated in a way corresponding to Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations propagating away from the Sun. For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation. We identify and collate several open questions and recommendations for future studies.",

      "summary": "Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.",

      "summary": "Full-disk observations from missions such as the SDO and SOHO have enabled comprehensive studies of solar oscillations and dynamics. Interpreting helioseismic and photospheric data is complicated by systematic center-to-limb variations. To explore the physical origin of these variations, we perform local 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations that include effects of solar rotation to generate 24-hour synthetic time series of continuum intensity and Doppler velocity for nine viewing angles spanning from -75 to 75 degrees. The simulations reveal a systematic decrease in oscillation power toward the limbs and a pronounced East-West asymmetry that increases with frequency, primarily due to rotation-induced flows. With increasing angular distance from the disk center, the amplitudes and widths of the surface gravity (f) and resonant pressure (p) modes decrease. In contrast, the amplitudes of the corresponding pseudo-modes with frequencies above the acoustic cut-off frequency increase in the intensity power spectra but are suppressed in the velocity spectra. The local helioseismology ring-diagram analysis of the simulation data further demonstrates anisotropic broadening of the modes and distinct differences in background noise and pseudo-mode structure between the intensity and velocity data. These results indicate that the center-to-limb effects arise from both geometric projection and physical factors such as line-formation height and potential effects of the radial differential rotation. The findings provide a framework for correcting helioseismic observations and demonstrate that realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations are a powerful tool for disentangling geometric and physical biases in solar data.",

      "summary": "Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.",

      "summary": "The origin of non-thermal power-law distribution functions ubiquitously observed in astrophysical/space (e.g., the solar wind) and laboratory kinetic plasmas, is not well understood. Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $\u03ba= 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $\u03ba\\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $\u03ba\\to 1.5$ limit.",

      "summary": "Our Sun is the closest X-ray astrophysical source to Earth. As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.",

A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.",

A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\u03b2$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.",

Such activity can pose significant operational challenges for critical infrastructure operators, particularly those managing electricity transmission networks, satellite constellations, and aviation systems. Substantial progress has been made in understanding space weather and the potential exposure of infrastructure assets to severe events. We have seen few evaluations of the types of current mitigation strategies in use to reduce our shared vulnerability to this activity, motivating this study. Firstly, we fill an important literature gap by undertaking a systematic review of the range of space weather mitigation strategies for these three critical infrastructure sectors. Secondly, we contacted 303 critical infrastructure operators (50 power, 227 satellite, 26 aviation) for participation in an anonymous online survey or interview receiving 55 unique responses (18% response rate). To capture narratives of mitigation actions taken and impacts experienced over the solar maximum, qualitative interviews were then conducted with 33 operators. The results identified 91 potential mitigation actions within the sectors and found that 149 mitigation actions were enacted due to space weather forecasts and experienced impacts. This is one of the first exhaustive studies of space weather mitigation activities, and moves beyond the traditional focus on purely impacts.",

About 20% of the events are quasi-laminar, showing single power-law spectra, whereas 80% are turbulent, exhibiting a spectral break separating inertial and kinetic ranges. A dawn-dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial-range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic-range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection-related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail-aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near -1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range. These results demonstrate that Mercury's unique plasma environment fundamentally reshapes the initiation of turbulence and the redistribution of energy in the magnetotail.",

      "summary": "Fast and slow solar wind have distinct properties linked to their solar sources.Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind complicates the usual speed-based classification, especially at intermediate speeds. Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfv\u00e9nic streams: one fast wind, three Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfv\u00e9nicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfv\u00e9nic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfv\u00e9nicity relates to the solar source conditions.",

We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations.",

      "summary": "In solar wind turbulence, the energy transfer/dissipation rate is typically estimated using MHD third-order structure functions calculated using spacecraft observations. However, the inherent anisotropy of solar wind turbulence leads to significant variations in structure functions along different observational directions, thereby affecting the accuracy of energy-dissipation rate estimation. An unresolved issue is how to optimise the selection of observation angles under limited directional sampling to improve estimation precision. We conduct a series of MHD turbulence simulations with different mean magnetic field strengths, $ B_0 $. Our analysis of the third-order structure functions reveals that the global energy dissipation rate estimated around a polar angle of $ \u03b8= 60^\\circ$ agrees reasonably with the exact one for $ 0 \\le B_0/b_{rms} \\le 5 $, where $b_{rms}$ denotes the root-mean-square magnetic field fluctuation. The speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle can be understood by the Mean Value Theorem of Integrals, since the spherical integral of the polar-angle component ($\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$) of the divergence of Yaglom flux is zero, and $\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$ changes sign around 60$^\\circ$. Existing theory on the energy flux vector as a function of the polar angle is assessed, and supports the speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle. The angular dependence of the third-order structure functions is further assessed with virtual spacecraft data analysis. The present results can be applied to measure the turbulent dissipation rates of energy in the solar wind, which are of potential importance to other areas in which turbulence takes place, such as laboratory plasmas and astrophysics.",

To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and \u03b8_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.",

Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.",

There exists some ambiguity whether magnetodisc scattering or high-latitude Alfvenic acceleration best describes the observed properties of these injection signatures, and also to what extent arcs in the outer emission are related to injections. Many injection signatures are the result of the evolution of dawn storms; there is, however, limited evidence that non-dawn-storm injection signatures are sometimes present in the aurora. We use automatic detection of these discrete features, alongside data from Juno-UVS and in-situ measurements by other Juno instruments, to show that scattering likely accounts for most of the electron precipitation associated with injection signatures. Additionally, there is evidence that injection signatures can be classified into two types: dawn-storm and non-dawn-storm. Arc-like features in the outer emission show very similar properties to traditional blob-like injection signatures and may consist of sequences of injection signatures that have broadened into an arc via energy-dependent electron drift.",

      "summary": "A common occurrence in weakly collisional space plasmas is the unequal electron-ion temperatures. The pressure-strain interaction provides a mechanism-agnostic pathway for increasing plasma internal energy through spatiotemporally local isotropic compression and volume preserving deformation, yet its behavior under thermal disequilibrium is largely unexplored. We investigate this using five fully kinetic two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of undriven decaying turbulence by varying the initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio. By analyzing the species' internal energy density alongside a decomposition of the pressure-strain term, with a focus on the volume-preserving deformation that contains normal and shear contributions, we quantify how the initial temperature imbalance modifies the channels through which turbulence increases each species' internal energy density. The cumulative pressure-strain interaction tracks the change in internal energy for both electrons and ions, with the total deformation channel of energy conversion dominating. We discover that local changes to electron internal energy density are governed primarily by the shear deformation power density, concentrated in electron-scale current sheets, while the ion shear and normal deformation components cancel, yielding a much smaller net deformation power density that peaks around, rather than within, those electron-scale current structures. We find that the amplitudes and localization of deformation change, but preserve these qualitative trends. Together, these results show how thermal disequilibrium could shape species-dependent turbulent \"heating rate\", measured via pressure-strain interaction and approximated via only its shear deformation part, and provide a framework for interpreting energy evolution and conversion in space plasmas where unequal species temperature is the norm.",

SWPC selected a set of 38 historical events over the period of five years from 2012--2014 (33 events) and 2017--2019 (5 events). The overall three-year project consisted of multiple simulation validation studies for the entire event set (1292 simulations): (a) benchmark single map (operational version prior to May 2019) (b) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving WSA-ENLIL with 4 different model settings (c) single test simulation of a time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (d) single GONG map driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (e) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL. We report that for all 38 events, within each model version/settings combination, the CME arrival time error decreased by 0.2 to 0.9 hours when using a sequence of time-dependent zero-point corrected magnetograms compared to using single magnetogram input. Overall, for all events, when using the older uncorrected magnetograms, the CME arrival time error increased for all new model versions/settings combination compared to the benchmark. Notably for the 5 events in the period 2017--2019 when more reliable zero-point corrected magnetograms were available, the ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (median arrival realization) CME arrival time error decreased against all benchmarks. In this report we also discuss replicating the operational model, challenges in detecting CME arrival in simulations, and comparing zero-point corrected and uncorrected magnetogram inputs.",

Working in the ultra-relativistic limit at leading logarithmic accuracy, the massive result smoothly reduces to its massless counterpart. We describe both quantum (Regge trajectory and BFKL $t$-channel evolution) and classical ($s$-channel multi-$H$ evolution) contributions using both an exponential representation of the S-matrix and a shock-wave formalism in light-cone quantisation. In the latter approach, gravitational Wilson lines evolve in rapidity space under a boost-invariant Hamiltonian, providing a space-time realisation of the high-energy dynamics and making contact with recent effective field theory descriptions in the forward limit. As an application, we compute the leading-logarithmic contribution to the massive spinless $2\\to2$ amplitude at 5PM-2SF order, recovering the previously determined massless result, and derive the tree-level $2\\to3$ amplitude and its associated scattering waveform for Kerr black holes in the ultra-relativistic limit.",

      "summary": "Earth matter density uncertainties play a non trivial role in three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter, particularly for the muon to electron appearance channel that underpins CP violation measurements in long baseline experiments. We demonstrate that when realistic spatial variations of the Earths density are taken into account, the oscillation probabilities acquire additional, energy dependent structures that cannot be captured by path-averaged density approximations. We show that mismodeling of the matter density profile can introduce degeneracies that obscure genuine leptonic CP violating effects, thereby degrading parameter sensitivity and biasing the inference of the CP phase. Identifying energy regions in which CP sensitivity remains robust against matter density uncertainties is therefore essential. These considerations indicate that marginalization over a single effective density parameter is insufficient for next generation precision measurements and motivate the incorporation of spatially resolved Earth density profiles in the analysis frameworks of future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.",

      "summary": "We apply the covariant entropy bound argument supporting the de Sitter swampland conjecture to the quintessence model, to find out the condition for the background to be unstable. More concretely, the background is unstable when the matter entropy given by the species number of the effective field theory increases more rapidly than the geometrical entropy proportional to the apparent horizon area, since it contradicts the covariant entropy bound. The rapid increase in the matter entropy is proposed by the distance conjecture, which states that the time evolution of some scalar field along the geodesic in the field space brings about the descent of a tower of states from UV. From this, we find that for the quintessence model, the accelerating background having the event horizon is unstable, and the instability condition as well as the lifetime of the unstable background is equivalent to the trans-Planckian censorship bound forbidding the classicalization of the trans-Planckian modes. We also point out that the scale separation between the Kaluza-Klein mass scale and the Hubble parameter can be realized when the product between the increasing rates of the matter and the geometrical entropies is bounded from below, which is consistent with the AdS distance conjecture. Our study suggests that various swampland conjectures can be comprehensively understood in the language of the entropy.",

Our findings for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model emphasize the critical role of properly separating medium effects from vacuum contributions in the model. The combined MFIR-MSS scheme suppresses spurious unphysical oscillations, often misinterpreted in the literature as de Haas--van Alphen oscillations, and ensures the correct high-density behavior of the diquark condensate. Furthermore, within the MSS framework, the magnetization remains positive across the explored parameter space, in sharp contrast with the behavior obtained in the traditional approach.",

The dependence of the extracted energy density is examined by adopting both a constant formation time and a centrality-dependent formation time derived from Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Corresponding Bjorken energy density estimates for Pb-Pb collisions are also presented for comparison. Taking the Bjorken energy density and formation time as initial conditions, the subsequent longitudinal evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these collisions is studied. Both ideal and first-order viscous boost-invariant hydrodynamics are employed to assess the influence of dissipation. We observe that viscous effects slow the longitudinal expansion and lead to entropy production dominated by early-time dynamics. The lifetime of the QGP is observed to increase with centrality and is substantially enhanced by viscous effects. These effects are highly sensitive to the choice of formation time, particularly in peripheral collisions. A comparative analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions demonstrates that the longitudinal evolution is primarily controlled by the initial energy density scale set by the Bjorken prescription. Consequently, when this scale is comparable, both systems exhibit nearly identical evolution patterns, while appreciable distinctions emerge in peripheral collisions due to system-size and geometric effects.",

In such a setup, we employ a model-independent approach to investigate the signature of sterile neutrinos in the half-life of the neutrinoless double beta ($0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$) decay process. In particular, we aim to study the contribution of sterile neutrinos in the mass range $\\sim$~keV that is motivated by the dark matter constituent of the Universe. Further, the masses of the sterile neutrinos are determined by the active neutrino masses, mixing angles, and phases, and active-sterile mixing angles and $CP$-violating phases. The parameter space is constrained by the exact seesaw relation, thereby making the analysis constrained. After capturing the parameter space that can account for $\\sim~$keV scale masses for the sterile neutrinos, we adopt the chiral effective field theory approach to calculate the half-life and effective mass in the $0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2$ decay. As the study transitions from the TeV scale to scenarios involving at least one sterile neutrino in the keV mass range, it reveals a significant modification of the effective mass. In particular, the cancellation region associated with the normal mass hierarchy for TeV-scale sterile neutrinos no longer persists when a keV-scale sterile neutrino is introduced, resulting in a finite effective mass that future experiments can probe. Likewise, the involvement of keV-scale sterile neutrino in the inverted mass hierarchy case makes the band distorted and scattered points appear around the main band.",

The color--magnetic fields associated with the gluon knot also induce a local chiral condensate, contributing to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the baryon mass. Extending this conjecture to heavy-flavor mesons, we argue that stable flux tubes and gluon knots may also play a role in their internal structure, whereas light-flavor mesons are dominated by alternative confinement mechanisms. Our approach provides a unified, topologically motivated picture linking confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the internal dynamics of baryons and certain mesons, suggesting that gluon knots constitute fundamental infrared degrees of freedom of Yang--Mills theory.",

These corrections can be summed up in a closed form through EFT coefficients up to all orders in derivatives and to the second order in curvature. It occurs that such a summation is convergent only for localizable theories, making a direct connection between the graviton scattering amplitudes properties and the applicability of a perturbative treatment of an EFT of gravity. We further apply our results to logarithmic form-factors which appear in the 1-loop effective action for GR in four dimensions. We find out that the corresponding corrections to the Schwarzschild metric are stronger than those from the tree-level EFT operators.

We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G.

Depending on the setup, the detectors are positioned either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with their energy gaps chosen to satisfy the hierarchy $\u03a9_C\\geq \u03a9_B\\geq \u03a9_A$. Our analysis reveals that decreasing the detector-boundary separation leads to a monotonic degradation of quantum coherence, whereas the same boundary effect can simultaneously preserve and even amplify the harvested quantum entanglement. Moreover, when the detectors possess distinct energy gaps, coherence extraction is further inhibited; strikingly, such non-identical configurations substantially enhance the efficiency of entanglement harvesting and markedly extend the range of detector separations over which non-negligible entanglement can be generated. Nevertheless, the harvesting of nonlocal quantum coherence is achievable over a significantly broader range of detector separations than that of quantum entanglement. Despite exhibiting similar overall behavior, orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel ones in coherence harvesting, highlighting the quantitative influence of detector geometry. Overall, our study reveals a hierarchical distinction between quantum coherence and entanglement as operational resources in structured vacuum fields: quantum coherence is not only more readily accessible across space but also more robust than entanglement, whereas entanglement exhibits richer features and can be selectively activated and enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity.",

D 98, 126009 (2018)] have analyzed a gedankenexperiment where two observers, Alice and Bob, attempt to communicate via superluminal signals using a superposition of massive particles dressed by Newtonian fields and a test particle as field detector. Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources.",

This \"rigidity\" is easily broken in the presence of higher-derivative corrections. Focusing on extremal charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell EFT, we compute the static linear response for both the vector ($\\ell=1$) and parity-odd tensor ($\\ell \\ge 2$) sectors. We find that the resulting tidal Love numbers are non-zero and exhibit logarithmic running, a hallmark of quantum corrections. Crucially, we show that the sign of these deformations is not arbitrary; the induced electric and magnetic susceptibilities and their log runnings in the $\\ell=1$ sector are constrained by unitarity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Furthermore, due to gravito-electromagnetic mixing, we find the cross log runnings and show that they are the same, which we explain through the worldline effective field theory.",

      "summary": "In this work, we study the spectral form factor of random matrix models which exhibit a large number of degenerate ground states accompanied by a macroscopic gap in the spectrum. The central aim of this work is to understand how the standard narrative about the behavior of the spectral form factor is modified in the presence of these parametrically large number of ground states. We show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the spectral form factor is dominated by the disconnected contribution, even at arbitrarily late times. Moreover, we demonstrate that the connected form factor only depends on the eigenvalues of the non-degenerate sector. Using the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, we analyze a number of examples including the Bessel model and $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim supergravity. In these examples, we find damped oscillations in the disconnected form factor, with a period set by the inverse size of the gap. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the slope of the ramp in the connected form factor arises from a universal sine-kernel, which emerges from a truncation of the full non-perturbative kernel in the $\\hbar \\to 0$ limit, and find agreement with the leading double trumpet result. Finally, we present predictions for how the ramp will transition to a plateau in the connected form factor and demonstrate how the transition depends on the details of the leading spectral density of states.",

      "summary": "Generalized Proca Theories are the most general higher-derivative extensions of a massive vector field that retain second-order equations of motion. They are phenomenologically interesting as models of dynamical dark energy that, unlike scalar-tensor theories, can naturally accommodate cosmological anisotropies. A key open question is whether such theories can be fundamental. As a first step in this direction, we investigate whether they admit an ultraviolet completion within a quantum field theory framework, working with a truncation comprising up to four powers of the Proca field and up to two derivatives. We find a triplet of non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed points, that lie very close to one another. Only one of them features a non-tachyonic Proca mass and could thus serve as a consistent ultraviolet completion for Generalized Proca Theories. We name it the Proca fixed point. We discuss its stability and contrast its features with those of the standard Reuter fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity and matter. In particular, we show that the Gaussian and Reuter fixed points lie on singular hypersurfaces of the flow of Generalized Proca Theories, yet can act as quasi-fixed points in certain regimes.",

We extend this framework to incorporate gravitationally induced particle creation, treating the region enclosed by the apparent horizon as an open thermodynamic system. A crucial aspect of our analysis is the recognition that the apparent horizon volume is not comoving; this requires a consistent accounting of particle exchange across the moving boundary. We demonstrate that the evolution of the particle number, and explicitly the matter entropy, can be decomposed into two distinct physical contributions: genuine bulk particle production and a net flux induced by the dynamics of the horizon itself. Finally, we derive the Generalized Second Law (GSL) in this setting, showing transparently how the total entropy budget is balanced by horizon thermodynamics, bulk creation, and boundary fluxes.",

In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $\u03bb(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \\to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent. Our results identify the Lyapunov exponent as a unified dynamical probe capable of capturing both first-order phase coexistence and second-order critical behavior in black-hole thermodynamics.",
