      "summary": "Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays are primarily estimated to arise from high-energy electromagnetic interactions in pulsars and their halo through electron inverse Compton (IC) scattering. Hadronic channels like neutral pion decay have also been proposed to produce TeV-PeV gamma rays from the Pulsar halo. The neutral pions are expected to be generated from cosmic ray (CR) protons interacting with the ambient/cloud. The recent observations of sub-PeV gamma rays from the halo of pulsar PSR J0622+3749 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory Kilometre-Square Array (LHAASO-KM2A) detector provide a platform to explore different channels of their production. Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $\u03b7_p\\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity. In this case, we have considered the protons propagating in a one-zone superdiffusion environment, specifically $\u03b1= 1$ in a cloud of gas density 1 per cm$^{3}$.",

      "summary": "In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.",

      "summary": "We develop a model of particle energization and emission from strongly turbulent black-hole coronae. Our local model is based on a set of 2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations with an electron-ion plasma composition, injection and diffusive escape of photons and charged particles, and self-consistent Compton scattering. We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow.",

      ],
      "summary": "Magnetar flares are highly energetic and rare events where intense high-energy emission is released from strongly magnetised neutron stars. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.",

General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \\lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios.",

Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor. We present highly magnetized, weakly magnetized, and non-magnetized pre-collapse stars, and discuss the observational implications for lGRB jets.",

      "summary": "Gravitational wave echoes offer a unique probe of the near-horizon structure of astrophysical black holes, beyond the standard ''black hole spectroscopy''. Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.",

We verify the universal relations obtained from conventional neutron stars in the case of quark stars and explore the cases with different values of parameters of the quark star equation of state. Since quark stars have significantly smaller radii compared to neutron stars in the low mass range, the relation between the tidal defomability and $f$-mode frequency times radius is different for neutron stars and quark stars. This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase. We calculate the tidal dephasing caused by this effect in the post-Newtonian method and find that it can not be detected even by the next-generation gravitational wave detectors.",

      "summary": "Collisionless fast-magnetosonic shocks are often treated as smooth, planar boundaries, yet observations point to organized corrugation of the shock surface. A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\u03b2$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.",

      "summary": "A theory of cosmic ray production within the solar system (not extra-galactic) is presented. The sun's time variable magnetic flux linkage makes the sun (as well, perhaps, as Jupiter) a natural, all-purpose, betatron storage ring, with semi-infinite acceptance aperture, capable of storing and accelerating counter-circulating, opposite-sign, colliding beams.   The puzzle of how positrons and anti-protons can be well represented at all energies, is explained, initially, by the low energy capture of particles of either sign by the sun's magnetic dipole field. Later, as the magnetic field bending has become negligible compared to the gravitational bending, both positive and negative beams will have survived the gradual transition from predominantly magnetic to predominantly gravitational bending. Later, anti-particles produced in QED beam-beam collisions of sufficiently high energy, are also accelerated.   The high quality of cosmic ray data collected over recent decades, at steadily increasing energies, especially by the International Space Station (ISS), make the study of cosmic ray production mechanisms both timely and essential.   The paper describes how longitudinal electric fields, explained by the Parker solar wind theory can enable the sun to serve as a ``booster'' accelerator of cosmic rays, increasing the maximum cosmic ray energies enough to produce the observed 13 orders of magnitude maximum particle energy and the energy flux needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray atmosphere equilibrium within the solar system.   A steady state mechanism is described, based on semi-quantitative discussion of a relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, according to which the highest energy cosmic rays observed can have been produced by the Parker longitudinal electric field component, during fractionally brief, but periodic, circular or semi-circular turns centered on the sun.",

We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $\u03c3_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $\u03b1$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $\u03b1\\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $\u03c3_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $\u03c3_0\\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations.

Using 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with a co-evolving fluid-particle framework, we investigate how particle feedback affects reconnection and acceleration. Our simulations demonstrate that particle feedback to the fluid amplifies shear flows within magnetic islands, which strengthens the convective electric field and thereby boosts particle acceleration. This mechanism results in a higher maximum particle energy and a harder non-thermal energy spectrum. The guide field suppresses both the increase in gas internal energy and particle acceleration. These findings highlight the complex interplay between feedback, guide fields, and reconnection dynamics.",

As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.",

      "summary": "We present Green's function solutions for a geometrically thin, one-dimensional Keplerian accretion disk that includes angular momentum extraction and mass loss due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. The disk viscosity is assumed to vary radially as $\u03bd\\propto r^{n}$. We derive solutions for three types of boundary conditions applied at the inner radius $r_{\\rm in}$: (i) zero torque, (ii) zero mass accretion rate, and (iii) finite torque and finite accretion rate, and investigate the time evolution of a disk with an initial surface density represented by a Dirac-delta function. The mass accretion rate at the inner radius decays with time as $t^{-3/2}$ for $n = 1$ at late times in the absence of winds under the zero-torque condition, consistent with Lynden-Bell \\& Pringle (1974), while the presence of winds leads to a steeper decay. All boundary conditions yield identical asymptotic time evolution for the accretion and wind mass-loss rates, though their radial profiles differ near $r_{\\rm in}$. Applying our solutions to protoplanetary disks, we find that the disk follows distinct evolutionary tracks in the accretion rate-disk mass plane depending on $\u03c8$, a dimensionless parameter that regulates the strength of the vertical stress driving the wind, with the disk lifetime decreasing as $\u03c8$ increases due to enhanced wind-driven mass loss. The inner boundary condition influences the evolution for $\u03c8< 1$ but becomes negligible at higher $\u03c8$, indicating that strong magnetically driven winds dominate and limit mass inflow near the boundary. Our Green's function solutions offer a general framework to study the long-term evolution of accretion disks with magnetically driven winds.",

Using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, we find tentative evidence for a month-scale QPO; however, its detection significance is limited by the small number of observed cycles. With a sufficiently long data set, the QPO may be detected with higher significance in the future. We further explored possible physical origins of this potential QPO and examined several models.

By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical\" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.",

By embedding the cosmological background equations directly into a Bayesian PINN architecture, we reconstruct the Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ in a data-driven yet physically consistent manner, while rigorously propagating epistemic uncertainties. Our analysis combines late-time observational probes, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO DESI DR2), and the Pantheon supernova sample, and quantifies the resulting tension in the inferred Hubble constant with respect to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and the SH0ES (R22) local distance ladder measurement. Within $\u039b$CDM, we find that data combinations involving BAO tend to favor lower values of $H_0$, alleviating the tension with Planck at the expense of increased disagreement with SH0ES. Allowing for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the CPL framework systematically shifts the posterior of $H_0$ toward higher values, leading to a notable reduction of the SH0ES tension, particularly for combinations including supernova data. The most flexible scenario, CPL with a free total neutrino mass $\u03a3m_\u03bd$, yields a balanced reconciliation between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, with tension levels typically reduced to the $\\sim1$-$2\u03c3$ range relative to both Planck and SH0ES. Our results highlight the nontrivial interplay between dark energy dynamics and neutrino mass in addressing the Hubble tension and demonstrate the efficacy of Bayesian PINNs as a robust and versatile tool for precision cosmology beyond the standard paradigm.",

The background falls within the mHz frequency band could become a potential observable for future space-based interferometers. Taiji, a proposed space mission slated for launch in the 2030s, will enable the study of such a background. However, the unique characteristics of space missions pose distinctive challenges for separating the stochastic background from instrumental noise. To address the data analysis requirements, we develop a preliminary pipeline to search for the SGWB and evaluate its performance with Taiji simulation datasets. At present, we demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully recover the parameters of injected background with a known spectral density after setting aside the complication of galactic binaries foreground. Furthermore, by employing the trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we extend the analysis to reconstruct the background with unknown spectral morphology.",

Our findings indicate that both the amplitudes and the intermediate behavior of these tails are influenced by quantum corrections.

In contrast to standard leptogenesis via freeze-in, our mechanism works even in the presence of a single RHN around the GeV scale. The mechanism is illustrated for the minimal type-I seesaw with two RHNs, where we show that successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis is viable in large regions of parameter space even without a small mass splitting between the RHNs.",

These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog -- containing basic properties of the host halos -- into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables.",

Extending previous formulations, a non-relativistic matter component is included explicitly, which allows a self consistent description of cosmological dynamics from the radiation-dominated era to late-time acceleration. Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed. These deviations can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon, but this is accompanied by correlated shifts in the matter density. The reconstructed expansion history remains close to LCDM at late times. Model comparison suggest that the interacting scenario is statistically competitive but not decisively preferred by current background data.",

At linear order, this framework predicts time- and scale-dependent bias parameters in a self-consistent manner, encompassing peak bias as a special case while clarifying how velocity bias and higher-derivative effects arise.

Detecting these weak, secondary temperature anisotropy signals of the CMB requires accurate theoretical predictions of their amplitude across cosmological models. By extending the pyGenISW package, previously limited to $\u039b$CDM, we aim to generate full-sky ISW maps for a suite of 791 $w$CDM cosmologies using the Gower Street N-body simulations, thereby enabling ISW analyses across a broader dark-energy parameter space. We make our code and ISW data publicly available. We compute the ISW signals by tracing the time evolution of the gravitational potential across large-volume simulations that span dark energy equation of state parameters from phantom to quintessence, $-1.79 \\lesssim w \\lesssim -0.34$. These data are projected onto the sphere using HEALPix to obtain full-sky temperature maps. We validate our pipeline by comparing the measured ISW angular power spectra and ISW-density cross-correlations against linear theory expectations ($2 \\leq \\ell \\leq 200$) computed with benchmarks from the pyCCL library. The agreement is excellent across the multipole range where the ISW contribution is expected to dominate, confirming the reliability of our modelling of gravitational-potential evolution. With additional tests of the ISW signal's strength in density extrema, as well as comparing all models to a reference $\u039b$CDM cosmology, we found that quintessence-like models ($w > -1$) show higher ISW amplitudes than phantom models ($w < -1$), consistent with enhanced late-time decay of gravitational potentials. The consistency of our $w$CDM ISW maps and their agreement with theory predictions confirm the robustness of our methodology, establishing it as a reliable tool for theoretical and observational ISW-LSS analyses.",

More specifically, we take generalized free fields in five dimensions, where the extra dimension is compactified to a circle. Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario ``gapped unparticles\". We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars. If we assume the interactions are localized on a brane, gapped unparticles with different effective masses will share a universal coupling, and their exchanges produce an interesting interference pattern.",

Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments.

Here we present a score-based diffusion approach, formulated using variance-exploding stochastic differential equations (VE-SDEs), to reconstruct the primordial B-mode angular power spectrum from contaminated observations. The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions.",

No effect is observed when irradiation occurs more than 3 $\u03bc$s before plasma generation. This timescale is attributed to the ambipolar diffusion of photoexcited carriers away from the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. When this delay shortens to less than 3 $\u03bc$s, the SIW propagates farther and with more intense optical emission. Furthermore, the energy of the discharge increases by up to 7%. The sensitivity to the laser-plasma delay demonstrates that the observed stimulation of the SIW cannot be due to the desorption of surface charge by irradiation.",

Analytical modelling and particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the maximum amplification in wakefield amplitude is obtained when spatial separation equals the plasma wavelength (\u03bb_p). The spatial intervals between laser pulses critically influence the wakefield amplification. These findings confirm that the two co-propagating lasers scheme provides a promising route toward stronger plasma wakefield excitation, potentially important for various applications.",

In line with this objective, a dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode has been built for the study of synthetic dye degradation. The plasma reactor was optimized by altering various operating conditions to achieve a higher degradation efficiency at given discharge conditions. The reaction kinetics of crystal violet degradation were studied, and the same plasma reactor was tested for other synthetic dyes (wastewater model samples).

      "summary": "The transition of the Divertor Tokamak Test (DTT) facility from its initial commissioning phase (Day-0, plasma current $I_{p}=2$ MA) to the full power scenario ($I_{p}=5.5$ MA) introduces a critical shift in the dynamics of runaway electrons (REs) generation. While previous predictive studies of the low-current scenario indicated a robust safety margin against RE beam formation, this work reveals that the exponential scaling of the RE avalanche gain with plasma current severely narrows the safe operational window in the full power scenario. Using the non-linear magnetohydrodynamic code JOREK, we perform comprehensive 2D simulations of the current quench (CQ) phase of several disruption scenarios, systematically scanning initial RE seed currents and injected impurity levels. The results demonstrate that in the full power scenario, the avalanche multiplication factor is sufficiently high ($G_\\text{av} \\approx 1.3 \\cdot 10^5$) to convert a mere 5.5 A seed current into macroscopic RE beams of $\\approx 0.7$ MA when large amounts of impurities are present. For even higher RE seeds, the RE current can peak at $ \\approx 3.2$ MA, constituting up to $\\approx$ 80% of the total plasma current during the CQ. These findings suggest that, unlike the Day-0 phase, the disruption mitigation strategy for the full power scenario involves a careful balance between thermal load mitigation and RE avoidance, necessitating a well-chosen quantity of injected impurities. This work provides the baseline needed for future estimations of RE loads on the plasma-facing components of DTT, which will be essential for designing and positioning mitigation components like sacrificial limiters.",

A charged body moving through a dusty plasma medium can generate diverse nonlinear waves, such as precursors and pinned solitons. These wave excitations under weakly nonlinear and dispersive limits are described theoretically by the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) type equation. We have examined the role of the driver in shaping and evolving these wave excitations. In particular we studied the effect of primarily three source parameters, namely, amplitude, width, and flow speed, on the evolution of nonlinear structures. The driver generates a perturbation in the stable system configuration, which couples with medium characteristics and eventually evolves into propagating excitations. Our finding shows that the excitation of nonlinear structure by a moving body in a plasma medium is not just dictated by the mach number but also the features of the source such as amplitude and width. As a novel finding apart from pinned and precursor solitons, we observe another nonlinear structure that lags behind the source term, maintaining its shape and speed as it propagates. These features are the first ever theoretical depiction of such lagging structures.",

Here, we introduce a general method for computing the shape of an ideal-MHD equilibrium that can be used in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric configurations. This framework uses a Fourier mode analysis to define the shaping modes (e.g. elongation, triangularity, squareness, etc.) of cross-sections that can be non-planar. Relative to an axisymmetric equilibrium, the additional degree of freedom in a non-axisymmetric equilibrium manifests as a rotation of each shaping mode about the magnetic axis. Using this method, a shaping analysis is performed on non-axisymmetric configurations with precise quasi-symmetry and select cases from the QUASR database spanning a range of quasi-symmetry quality. Empirically, we find that quasi-symmetry results from a spatial resonance between shape complexity and shape rotation about the magnetic axis. The quantitative features of this resonance correlate closely with a configuration's rotational transform and number of field periods. Based on these observations, it is conjectured that this shaping paradigm can facilitate systematic investigations into the relationship between general flux-surface geometries and other figures of merit.",

High-fidelity edge fluid/neutral codes such as SOLPS-ITER capture SOL physics with high accuracy, but their computational cost limits broad parameter scans and long transient studies. We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions. Measured end-to-end wall-clock times show the surrogate is orders of magnitude faster than SOLPS-ITER, enabling rapid parameter exploration. Prediction accuracy degrades when the surrogate enters physical regimes not represented in the training dataset, motivating future work on data enrichment and physics-informed constraints. Overall, this approach provides a fast, accurate surrogate for computationally intensive plasma edge simulations, supporting rapid scenario exploration, control-oriented studies, and progress toward real-time applications in fusion devices.",

      "summary": "The efficiency of recombination is of crucial importance for the existence of ultracold plasmas, particularly, the ones formed in the magneto-optical traps. Unfortunately, a straightforward simulation of the recombination encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the \"virtual\" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such simulations, and it is necessary to employ some additional criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms (this might be a minimal number of revolutions of the electron about the nearest ion or a maximal distance between them). It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful ab initio simulation of the recombination without any auxiliary assumptions. We employed a special algorithm, which was based on: (i) using the \"scalable\" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding plasma, (ii) dynamical choice of the number of \"mirror\" cells, taking into account in calculation of the Coulomb sums, and (iii) accurate treatment of the singular interparticle interactions, without any truncation or \"softening\" of the Coulomb forces. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies for a sample of particles, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of the particle trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace formation of the real - rather than \"virtual\" - electron-ion pairs. The total efficiency of recombination for the realistic experimental conditions was found to be about 20%, which is in perfect agreement both with the laboratory measurements and with the earlier semi-empirical simulations.",

The confinement of cold energetic electrons produced near the hollow cathode plays a crucial role in guiding the plasma along the device axis. Experimental diagnostics reveal a high concentration of energetic electrons in the peripheral region near the source, which progressively converge toward the axis at a downstream location approximately 3.0 meters from the cathode. The length of the plasma column exhibits an inverse relationship with the electron-neutral collision frequency, indicating the significance of collisional damping in the propagation of energetic electrons. These observations are further supported by fluid simulations performed using COMSOL Multiphysics, which qualitatively reproduce the experimental trends. The results are consistent with a theoretical model previously proposed by the authors, reinforcing the understanding of energetic electron behaviour in magnetically guided plasma columns.",

Seed dormancy is a key factor influencing germination and seedling establishment. Three dormancy-breaking methods were compared: gibberellic acid, scarification and cold plasma. The efficiency and selectivity were evaluated through germination ability, time to 10% germination (T10), mean germination time and greenhouse emergence. Five days after imbibition, germination was only 18% for the untreated seeds but 60% for the plasma-treated seeds. Germination also began 24 hours earlier and mean germination time was reduced across most populations. However, there was a limited effect on seedling emergence, which remained around 55% for both untreated and treated samples. Comparative analysis indicates that cold plasma was more effective in alleviating embryo dormancy. In addition, histological and scanning electron microscopy showed that the seed coat differed according to the geographical origin of the populations, with a deeper dormancy in seeds from Sicilian populations.",

      "summary": "Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\\rm e}$) is critical for non-equilibrium plasma applications ranging from hypersonic flight to plasma-assisted combustion. We recently proposed a thermodynamically consistent model for vibrational-electron heating [Phys. Fluids 37, 096141 (2025)] that enforces the convergence of $T_{\\rm e}$ to the vibrational temperature ($T_{\\rm v}$) at equilibrium. However, the original derivation was restricted to single-quantum transitions, limiting its validity to low-temperature regimes ($T_{\\rm e} \\lesssim 1.5$ eV). In this Letter, we generalize the model to include multi-quantum overtone transitions, extending its applicability to high-energy regimes. We demonstrate that previous models neglecting hot-band transitions incur a systematic heating error of $\\exp(-\u03b8_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm v})$, where $\u03b8_{\\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature. This error exceeds 40\\% when $T_{\\rm v}$ is greater than $\u03b8_{\\rm v}$, effectively preventing thermal relaxation. To correct this, we derive a formulation where the total heating rate is a summation of channel-specific cooling rates $Q_{\\rm e-v}^{(m)}$, each associated with a quantum jump $m$, scaled by a thermodynamic factor $\\exp(m\u03b8_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm e}-m\u03b8_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm v})$.

In this work, we investigate the accessibility of such a reactor-relevant low-beta regime in a reactor-scale quasi-axisymmetric stellarator using state-of-the-art high-fidelity macro- and microscopic simulation tools. We consider a configuration with a flattened core pressure profile and favourable properties from the macroscopic and neoclassical perspectives. By contrast, linear and nonlinear calculations with the GENE code show an abrupt transition to a regime of highly deleterious transport at low (local) plasma beta. We describe the characterisation of these transport regimes as well as the confinement transition. We discuss the implications broadly for stellarator optimisation and highlight the impact on quasi-symmetric stellarator design strategies.",

      "summary": "Helicon plasma sources play a central role in applications ranging from material treatment to space propulsion and fusion, yet the physical processes governing their ignition, transient ionization, and mode evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we develop a self-consistent, fully coupled multiphysics framework that integrates Maxwell equations, electron energy transport, drift-diffusion kinetics, and heavy-species chemistry to capture the complete spatiotemporal evolution of helicon discharges. The model reproduces experimental measurements across pressure, magnetic field, and frequency ranges, and reveals a previously unresolved transient ionization stage characterized by a rapid density rise within ~10-4 s, accompanied by a two-peak electron temperature structure that governs the formation of the dense plasma core. By tracking the RF power flow and field topology, we characterize the transient redistribution of RF energy during ignition. A short-lived phase of localized energy deposition accompanies the onset of ionization, followed by an evolution toward helicon-like field characteristics together with rapid density growth and profile restructuring. Systematic parametric scans further reveal the sensitivity of this mode-coupling process to gas pressure, magnetic field strength, and driving frequency. These results provide a unified picture of the ignition and mode-transition physics in helicon plasmas and establish a predictive tool for the design and optimization of RF plasma sources across space propulsion, manufacturing, and fusion technologies.",

The simulations have been performed within the ASTRA+STRAHL framework, using FACIT and TGLF-SAT2 to predict, respectively, neoclassical and turbulent core transport, while a neural network trained on EPED simulations has been employed to calculate the pedestal height and width self-consistently. A benchmark with previous simulations at constant impurity fraction has been provided for three H-modes, spanning different plasma current and magnetic field values. For a scenario, additional simulations have been performed to account for uncertainties in the modeling assumptions. The predictions are nearly insensitive to changes in the top of pedestal W concentrations. Varying the Ar pedestal concentration has shown a small effect on the impurity peaking and nearly constant fusion gain values, due to multiple effects on pedestal pressure, main ion dilution and density peaking. The inclusion of rotation in ASTRA simulations has shown minimal impact on confinement and impurity transport predictions. An exploratory study has been provided with a first set of simulations treating D and T separately, experiencing a maximum fusion power at 55-45% DT fuel composition, and an asymmetric distribution with respect to the D concentration. All the results, including sensitivity scans of toroidal velocity and ion temperature and density gradients, highlighted that turbulent impurity transport prevails on the neoclassical component, aligning with previous ITER predictions, and suggesting that next generation devices like SPARC, operating at low collisionality, will experience low W accumulation.",

Such beams are under active investigation for applications in proton beam therapy, materials modification, and nuclear and high-energy-density physics. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical effort, predictive correlations between laser and target parameters and the resulting ion-beam properties remain an open research question, owing to the intrinsically multiphysics and strongly coupled nature of laser-plasma interactions. Here, we employ our unified multiphysics model that reproduces laser-solid interaction dynamics with accuracy exceeding 95% over a broad range of short- and ultrashort-pulse conditions. Using this model, we derive statistically validated scaling laws and probability maps that correlate proton, carbon, and oxygen ion cutoff energies, beam divergences, and ionization states to a wide set of laser and target parameters, including pulse duration, laser power, laser beam spot, target thickness, prepulse-main pulse interval, contrast, laser wavelength, and polarization. Continuous beam properties (cutoff energies and beam divergences) are described using multivariate regression with cross-validation, while discrete ionization states are analyzed using classification and regression tree (CART) methods, enabling nonlinear and threshold-dependent behavior to be captured. The resulting scaling relations, contour maps, and box plots elucidate the coupled roles of laser pulse, and target geometry in governing TNSA ion acceleration and charge-state formation. These results provide a predictive and physically interpretable framework for understanding and optimizing laser-driven ion sources across a wide parameter space.",

      "summary": "High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $\u03b3$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.",

      "summary": "Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field.   Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime.   Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches.   Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.",

Nanoflares analyzed in this study were generated self-consistently via prescribed photospheric motions in a 3D multi-strand simulation of a subset of active region magnetic flux. Energies and durations were quantified using three distinct methods. In this study, we investigated the correlation between nanoflare energies (E) and delays ($\u03c4_D$) using two non-parametric, rank-based statistical tests. Across all methods, results consistently show little to no correlation. This is further supported by the distribution of the exponent $\u03b1$ in the assumed relation $E \\propto \u03c4_D^\u03b1$, which peaks near zero, and by broad delay distributions within fixed energy bins. These findings are irrespective of whether delays are correlated with the energy of the preceding or subsequent event. They also hold for a subset of high-energy nanoflares. The absence of correlation suggests that nanoflare onset is not solely determined by a critical value of magnetic stress and may involve triggering by other events, perhaps related to a locally complex topology.",

Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfv\u00e9nic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfv\u00e9nic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.",

We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 \u03bcm), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 \u03bcm). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.",

Using the aspect ratio as a perturbation parameter, we compute particle trajectories sampled from the kinetic equilibrium distribution, confirming the overall stability of the solutions. However, under burning plasma conditions, chaotic dynamics emerge for particles with supra-thermal and even thermal energies. This destroys the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment. The exact consequences are unclear, but they could undermine the foundational assumptions of gyrokinetic modelling in burning plasmas. Nevertheless, these results suggest the possibility of unaccounted transport losses in future burning plasma operations.

We also present a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides a clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions. Finally, we explore the computational advantages of the dynamical-time formulation over the conventional uniform-time approach in two study cases: an uniform electromagnetic field and an elliptically polarized wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field.

The critical role of multi-harmonic ECW in enhancing the driven current has been experimentally verified for the first time. To explain the related experimental observations, a physical mechanism involving multi-harmonic heating, multiple reflections, and multi-pass absorption - leading to the generation of high-energy electrons via X-mode wave or electron Bernstein wave has been proposed. The current drive capacity of the first harmonic extraordinary mode of the ECW has also been experimentally confirmed for the first time.

We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

Initially, the fast particles-induced enhancement of shearing structures from turbulence self-interaction is analyzed. Our study takes into account the competition between this mechanism and other fast ions effects, i.e. thermal profiles dilution and quasi-resonant interaction. We find the fast ions-induced reduction of destabilization threshold for the zonal modes to be a very efficient way to suppress turbulence. Indeed, it leads to the formation of regions where turbulent transport is reduced by 90\\% of its original value. Furthermore, an $n=m=1$ fishbone is driven unstable inside the plasma and its interaction with turbulence is studied. We find the beat-driven zonal structure generate by this mode to further reduce turbulence when its presence does not drastically flatten the thermal profiles.",

Deep neural networks can provide accurate estimates of $n_e$ and $T_e$ when conventional fitting algorithms may fail, such as when TS spectra are dominated by noise, or when fast analysis is required for real-time operation. Although deep neural networks typically require large training sets, transfer learning can improve model performance on a target task with limited data by leveraging pre-trained models from related source tasks, where select hidden layers are further trained using target data. We present five architecturally diverse deep neural networks, pre-trained on synthetic TS data and adapted for experimentally measured TS data, to evaluate the efficacy of transfer learning in estimating $n_e$ and $T_e$ in both the collective and non-collective scattering regimes. We evaluate errors in $n_e$ and $T_e$ estimates as a function of training set size for models trained with and without transfer learning, and we observe decreases in model error from transfer learning when the training set contains $\\lessapprox$ 200 experimentally measured spectra.",

      "summary": "Communication blackout due to the plasma layer creates a critical telemetry gap for re-entry vehicles. To mitigate this, we present the first fully-coupled simulation of high-voltage pulsed discharges interacting with a Mach 24 flowfield. The results demonstrate that the applied electric field generates a large, non-neutral plasma sheath near the cathode, depleting electron density by several orders of magnitude over a distance commensurate with the height of the shock layer. This depletion window effectively reduces the attenuation of a 4 GHz signal from 60% to 4% with a manageable power requirement of 66 W per cm$^2$ of exposed cathode surface. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the sheath topology is governed principally by ion kinetics; specifically, corrections to ion mobility at high reduced electric fields lead to enhanced space-charge shielding and a subsequent contraction of the sheath. Conversely, the sheath structure is largely insensitive to the electron mobility model. Finally, we argue that the present drift-diffusion model likely yields a conservative lower bound for mitigation performance. A kinetic approach accounting for ballistic ion transport and non-local ionization would likely predict thicker sheaths and lower attenuation for equivalent power deposition.",

The toolbox includes fully transparent, editable MATLAB source code and offers an advanced description of electron transport in addition to commonly used approaches in the plasma modelling community. It supports one-dimensional and two-dimensional modelling geometries employing Cartesian, polar and cylindrical coordinate systems. MCPlas is tested on two reference cases: DC- and RF-driven low-pressure glow discharges in argon. Comparison of MCPlas results with results obtained by employing COMSOL's Plasma Module verifies the reliability of the plasma model implemented by MCPlas and demonstrates the significance of electron transport treatment and boundary conditions applied in the toolbox. Using the same examples, the easy handling of complex reaction kinetic models in MCPlas and the reusability of its JSON input data across different modelling platforms are illustrated. This demonstrates that MCPlas provides a transparent and reproducible workflow for the simulation of non-thermal plasmas using COMSOL.",

Density scans are performed to reproduce the experimental roll-over of the outer-target ion saturation current and to investigate detachment physics for both forward and reverse toroidal magnetic field configurations. Consistent with experiments, the simulations show that approximately 40% higher density is required to reach detachment onset for forward BT compared to reverse BT, and that deep detachment is not achieved for reverse BT. Comparisons with positive triangularity Ohmic discharges further demonstrate that negative triangularity requires substantially higher densities, at or above the Greenwald limit, to access detachment. The modeling indicates that the increased difficulty of achieving detachment in negative triangularity arises from a shorter midplane-to-target connection length, a reduced outer divertor leg length, and lower cross-field transport compared to positive triangularity configurations.",

      "summary": "Since the first H-mode transitions were observed in TJ-II plasmas in 2008, an extensive experimental effort has been done aiming a better physics understanding of confinement transitions. In this paper, an overview of the main findings related to the L-H transition in TJ-II is presented including how the radial electric field is driven, which are the possible mechanisms for turbulence suppression, and what are the related temporal and spatial scales which can impact the transition. The trigger of the L-H transition in TJ-II plasmas is found to be more correlated with the development of fluctuating $E\\times B$ flows than with steady-state $E_r$ effects, pointing to the role played by zonal flows in mediating the transition. Experimental evidence supporting the predator-prey relationship between turbulence and flows as the basis for the L-H transition, found for the first time in TJ-II, reinforces this conclusion. Besides, the reduction in the turbulent transport at the transition is detected at the barrier region but also in a wider radial range with weak or even zero $E\\times B$ flow shear, what points to other mechanisms beyond the turbulence suppression by local sheared flows.",

Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.",

A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.",

Such activity can pose significant operational challenges for critical infrastructure operators, particularly those managing electricity transmission networks, satellite constellations, and aviation systems. Substantial progress has been made in understanding space weather and the potential exposure of infrastructure assets to severe events. We have seen few evaluations of the types of current mitigation strategies in use to reduce our shared vulnerability to this activity, motivating this study. Firstly, we fill an important literature gap by undertaking a systematic review of the range of space weather mitigation strategies for these three critical infrastructure sectors. Secondly, we contacted 303 critical infrastructure operators (50 power, 227 satellite, 26 aviation) for participation in an anonymous online survey or interview receiving 55 unique responses (18% response rate). To capture narratives of mitigation actions taken and impacts experienced over the solar maximum, qualitative interviews were then conducted with 33 operators. The results identified 91 potential mitigation actions within the sectors and found that 149 mitigation actions were enacted due to space weather forecasts and experienced impacts. This is one of the first exhaustive studies of space weather mitigation activities, and moves beyond the traditional focus on purely impacts.",

      "summary": "Fast and slow solar wind have distinct properties linked to their solar sources.Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind complicates the usual speed-based classification, especially at intermediate speeds. Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfv\u00e9nic streams: one fast wind, three Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfv\u00e9nicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfv\u00e9nic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind streams.

      "summary": "Mars lacks a global intrinsic dipole magnetic field, but its interaction with the solar wind generates a global induced magnetosphere. Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations.",

      "summary": "In solar wind turbulence, the energy transfer/dissipation rate is typically estimated using MHD third-order structure functions calculated using spacecraft observations. However, the inherent anisotropy of solar wind turbulence leads to significant variations in structure functions along different observational directions, thereby affecting the accuracy of energy-dissipation rate estimation. An unresolved issue is how to optimise the selection of observation angles under limited directional sampling to improve estimation precision. We conduct a series of MHD turbulence simulations with different mean magnetic field strengths, $ B_0 $. Our analysis of the third-order structure functions reveals that the global energy dissipation rate estimated around a polar angle of $ \u03b8= 60^\\circ$ agrees reasonably with the exact one for $ 0 \\le B_0/b_{rms} \\le 5 $, where $b_{rms}$ denotes the root-mean-square magnetic field fluctuation. The speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle can be understood by the Mean Value Theorem of Integrals, since the spherical integral of the polar-angle component ($\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$) of the divergence of Yaglom flux is zero, and $\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$ changes sign around 60$^\\circ$. Existing theory on the energy flux vector as a function of the polar angle is assessed, and supports the speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle. The angular dependence of the third-order structure functions is further assessed with virtual spacecraft data analysis. The present results can be applied to measure the turbulent dissipation rates of energy in the solar wind, which are of potential importance to other areas in which turbulence takes place, such as laboratory plasmas and astrophysics.",

To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and \u03b8_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.",

Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.",

There exists some ambiguity whether magnetodisc scattering or high-latitude Alfvenic acceleration best describes the observed properties of these injection signatures, and also to what extent arcs in the outer emission are related to injections. Many injection signatures are the result of the evolution of dawn storms; there is, however, limited evidence that non-dawn-storm injection signatures are sometimes present in the aurora. We use automatic detection of these discrete features, alongside data from Juno-UVS and in-situ measurements by other Juno instruments, to show that scattering likely accounts for most of the electron precipitation associated with injection signatures. Additionally, there is evidence that injection signatures can be classified into two types: dawn-storm and non-dawn-storm. Arc-like features in the outer emission show very similar properties to traditional blob-like injection signatures and may consist of sequences of injection signatures that have broadened into an arc via energy-dependent electron drift.",

      "summary": "A common occurrence in weakly collisional space plasmas is the unequal electron-ion temperatures. The pressure-strain interaction provides a mechanism-agnostic pathway for increasing plasma internal energy through spatiotemporally local isotropic compression and volume preserving deformation, yet its behavior under thermal disequilibrium is largely unexplored. We investigate this using five fully kinetic two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of undriven decaying turbulence by varying the initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio. By analyzing the species' internal energy density alongside a decomposition of the pressure-strain term, with a focus on the volume-preserving deformation that contains normal and shear contributions, we quantify how the initial temperature imbalance modifies the channels through which turbulence increases each species' internal energy density. The cumulative pressure-strain interaction tracks the change in internal energy for both electrons and ions, with the total deformation channel of energy conversion dominating. We discover that local changes to electron internal energy density are governed primarily by the shear deformation power density, concentrated in electron-scale current sheets, while the ion shear and normal deformation components cancel, yielding a much smaller net deformation power density that peaks around, rather than within, those electron-scale current structures. We find that the amplitudes and localization of deformation change, but preserve these qualitative trends. Together, these results show how thermal disequilibrium could shape species-dependent turbulent \"heating rate\", measured via pressure-strain interaction and approximated via only its shear deformation part, and provide a framework for interpreting energy evolution and conversion in space plasmas where unequal species temperature is the norm.",

SWPC selected a set of 38 historical events over the period of five years from 2012--2014 (33 events) and 2017--2019 (5 events). The overall three-year project consisted of multiple simulation validation studies for the entire event set (1292 simulations): (a) benchmark single map (operational version prior to May 2019) (b) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving WSA-ENLIL with 4 different model settings (c) single test simulation of a time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (d) single GONG map driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (e) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL. We report that for all 38 events, within each model version/settings combination, the CME arrival time error decreased by 0.2 to 0.9 hours when using a sequence of time-dependent zero-point corrected magnetograms compared to using single magnetogram input. Overall, for all events, when using the older uncorrected magnetograms, the CME arrival time error increased for all new model versions/settings combination compared to the benchmark. Notably for the 5 events in the period 2017--2019 when more reliable zero-point corrected magnetograms were available, the ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (median arrival realization) CME arrival time error decreased against all benchmarks. In this report we also discuss replicating the operational model, challenges in detecting CME arrival in simulations, and comparing zero-point corrected and uncorrected magnetogram inputs.",

We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.",

In this work, we built SEPNet, an innovative multi-task neural network that jointly predicts future solar eruptive events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and SEPs, incorporating long short-term memory and transformer architectures that capture contextual dependencies. SEPNet is a machine learning framework for SEP prediction that utilizes an extensive set of predictors, including solar flares, CMEs, and space-weather HMI active region patches (SHARP) magnetic field parameters. SEPNet is rigorously evaluated on the SEPVAL SEP dataset (whitman, 2025b), which is used to evaluate the performance of the current SEP prediction models. The performance of SEPNet is compared with classical machine learning methods and current state-of-the-art pre-eruptive SEP prediction models. The results show that SEPNet, particularly with SHARP parameters, achieves higher detection rates and skill scores while maintaining suitable for real-time space weather alert operations. Although class imbalance in the data leads to relatively high false alarm rates, SEPNet consistently outperforms reference methods and provides timely SEP forecasts, highlighting the capability of deep multi-task learning for next-generation space weather prediction.

The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms.",

      "summary": "Magnetic reconnection powers explosive releases of magnetic energy, heating and particle acceleration throughout the plasma universe. Knowledge of this universal process is vital to understanding the Heliosphere, as it plays a key role in solar flares, coronal mass ejections, coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, geomagnetic storms, and interactions between the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. As such, reconnection underpins multiple science objectives of multiple future space missions. The UK plays a leading role in this international field, through a combination of in situ measurements from Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind, observations of the solar corona and chromosphere, and world-class numerical simulations and theory. This white paper identifies: Nine priority science objectives for reconnection research in the next decade; Recommendations to guide investment in theory, simulations and infrastructure; Mission priorities and required measurements to ensure the UK maintains and improves its world-class credentials in reconnection science.",

These waves are a signature of the interplay between plasma microinstabilities and turbulent dissipation. We perform a mission-wide statistical survey of ion-scale waves observed by PSP, investigating if the waves correspond to specific free energy sources in the measured proton velocity distributions. We find that left-handed waves (LHWs) are frequently observed, with the fraction of time they are observed increasing closer to the Sun, reaching $\\sim$30\\%. Right-handed waves (RHWs) are less frequently observed, with the associated time fraction decreasing closer to the Sun. The observed LHWs are generally consistent with parallel propagating ion cyclotron wave (ICW) storms that occur continuously for extended periods of time. Turbulent energy spectra are consistently steeper when LHW storms are observed; these wave storms mediate the spatial transport of the free energy associated with temperature anisotropy. The observed RHWs are generally consistent with oblique and parallel fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs), and their observation is well correlated with enhanced proton parallel heat flux, which quantifies the presence of secondary proton populations. Using observations and the SAVIC machine learning instability identification algorithm, we identify a threshold on the proton heat flux beyond which FMWs are likely to be driven unstable by the proton beams. We are thus able to associate trends in the observed ion-scale waves with known sources of free energy for Encounters 3 through 24 of the PSP's prime science phase.",

This paper advances the hypothesis that a combination of microgravity and ultra-low temperature (near absolute zero) provides an almost \"ideal\" operating environment for quantum hardware. Under such conditions, gravitational perturbations, thermal noise, and vibrational disturbances are minimized, thereby significantly extending qubit coherence times and reducing error rates. We survey four leading qubit platforms - superconducting circuits, trapped ions, ultracold neutral atoms, and photonic qubits - and explain how each can benefit from a weightless, cryogenic setting. Recent experiments support this vision: Bose-Einstein condensates on the International Space Station (ISS) maintained matter-wave coherence far longer than on Earth, atomic clocks in orbit achieved record stability, and a photonic quantum computer deployed in space is demonstrating robust operation. Finally, we outline a proposed side-by-side experiment comparing identical quantum processors on the ground and in microgravity. Such a test would directly measure improvements in qubit coherence (T1, T2), gate fidelity, and readout accuracy when the influence of gravity is removed.",

      "summary": "Venus, in the absence of an intrinsic magnetic field, undergoes a direct interaction between its ionosphere and the solar wind. Previous missions, including Mariner, Venera, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), reported a recurring localized increase in electron density, often termed a \"bulge,\" at altitudes between 160 and 200 km. This study investigates this topside bulge using over 200 dayside electron density profiles derived from the Venus Radio Science experiment (VeRa) onboard the Venus Express (VEX). We employ an automated, gradient-based classification algorithm to provide a quantitative and reproducible method for identifying and categorizing the bulge morphology into three types. Type 1 profiles exhibit a distinct secondary peak above the main V2 layer. Type 2 profiles display a shoulder-like feature near the bulge altitude. Type 3 bulges are not visually apparent but can be identified through residuals obtained after subtracting a Chapman layer fit to the V2 peak. The bulge is detected in over 80\\% of the analyzed profiles, with a higher occurrence during periods of low solar activity and at lower solar zenith angles (SZA). Type 1 morphologies are only observed at low latitudes (within $\\pm 40^\\circ$). The peak altitude of the bulge negatively correlates with SZA, suggesting that thermospheric cooling toward the terminator significantly influences the bulge altitude. The occurrence patterns and morphological characteristics indicate that the bulge is likely influenced by external drivers, such as solar wind interaction, rather than being solely a result of local photochemical processes.",

To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\\perp/T_\\|\\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs. Finally, this paper underscores the importance of high-resolution observations of the solar wind velocity distributions around RDs.",

      "summary": "The Earth's magnetosheath provides a high $\u03b2$ (ratio of electron thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) plasma environment where kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves (KAWs) strongly influence turbulence and energy dissipation. This study investigates how Landau damping modifies the nonlinear evolution of KAWs by solving a modified nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation that captures both dispersive and nonlinear effects. Without Landau damping, modulational instability drives rapid self-focusing into intense magnetic filaments, producing a turbulent cascade with $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling in the inertial range ($k_\\perp\u03c1_i<1$) that transitions to $k_\\perp^{-8/3}$ at sub-ion scales ($k_\\perp\u03c1_i>1$), here $k_\\perp$ is the wavevector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field and $\u03c1_i$ the ion thermal gyroradius. When Landau damping is included, magnetic structures are significantly suppressed, and the spectrum steepens to $k_\\perp^{-11/3}$ in the sub-ion range while the inertial range maintains $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling. The damping acts across all scales through resonant wave-particle interactions, efficiently transferring energy from waves to particles. Direct comparison with Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations shows that the observed kinetic range spectral slope falls between our undamped and damped simulation limits, consistent with an intermediate damping regime in magnetosheath turbulence. This agreement confirms that Landau damping is one of the primary mechanisms controlling turbulent energy dissipation at kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas.",

Our investigation, preparing for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from beyond 35\u00b0 elongation are used. These findings pave the way for optimising real-time prediction methodologies, providing valuable groundwork for the forthcoming Vigil mission and enhancing preparedness for CME-driven space weather events.",

Analytical expressions for the diffusion tensor components in the Fokker-Planck equation that take this effect into account have been found. The equation was solved numerically in the case of magnetostatic turbulence. It has been demonstrated that the skin effect increases the mean free path of particles in turbulent plasma, thereby reducing its anomalous resistance. It also leads to anisotropy in particle scattering, resulting in anisotropy in their stationary velocity distribution, which increases as the screening parameter grows. Approximate analytical formulas for the effective mobility of charged particles and the electric conductivity of plasma with isotropic magnetostatic turbulence have been obtained.",

The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight.",

By formulating the geometric shape of the scattered wave spectrum in wave number space, where the velocity vector of the beam component and the wave vectors of the incident and scattered waves are arbitrary, it is demonstrated that the spectrum in 2D wave number space becomes asymmetric. The spectrum of scattered waves propagating in a specific direction is presented as a function of wavelength to show that the electron (ion) feature is amplified and becomes asymmetric or distorted when Buneman (ion acoustic) instability occurs. An additional simulation is conducted for a weak, linearly stable beam-plasma system with a hot beam, and confirmed that the obtained scattered wave spectrum shows asymmetric feature. The results are expected to be applicable to the interpretation of radar observations of ionospheric plasmas as well as CTS measurements in laboratory plasmas.",

Combined with an efficient Cholesky rank-one downdating scheme, PARIS performs fast, iterative pruning that eliminates uninformative or performance-degrading samples.   We use a real-world space weather example, where PARIS reduces the training set by up to 75\\% while preserving or improving overall RMSE, outperforming re-weighting, synthetic oversampling, and boosting baselines.

We have updated one of the most comprehensive in situ ICME catalogs to date, which now includes 1976 events from 11 space missions covering over 34 years, from December 1990 to August 2025. We have combined existing catalogs including magnetic obstacles and identified and added boundaries of an additional 807 (40.8%) events ourselves. With this catalog, we demonstrate the most extensive analysis to date of total ICME magnetic field values as a function of heliocentric distance. Parker Solar Probe has observed 6 ICMEs at $< 0.23$ au (until April 2025), and Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo have added more events near 0.3~au, bridging the major observational gap towards the solar corona. Our main result is that a single power law can describe the evolution of the mean total magnetic field (exponent value of $k=-1.57$) and maximum field ($k=-1.53$) in the magnetic obstacle (MO), from 0.07 to 5.4 au. Extending the power law to the solar photosphere reveals a strong inconsistency with magnetic field magnitudes observed in the quiet Sun and active regions by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively. We introduce a multipole-type power law with two exponents, $k_1=-1.57$, and $k_2=-6$, relating the ICME magnetic field magnitude to an average solar active region field strength. These results present important observational constraints for the evolution of ICMEs from the Sun to the heliosphere.",

The Cairns-Gurevich distribution as the electron distribution is considered to describe the plasma nonthermality and particle trapping. By adopting the reductive perturbation technique, we derived the nonlinear Schamel-Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (SKdVB) equation, and then obtained the ion-acoustic shock and solitary wave solutions of the SKdVB equation for different limiting cases. It is found that the impact of nonthermal parameter \u03b1, external magnetic field \u03a9, obliqueness lz, wave speed U0, and the ion kinematic viscosity \u03b70 can significantly change the characteristics of the shock and solitary waves. These results may be useful for better understanding the propagation of nonlinear structures in space (i.e. Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere, auroral regions) and laboratory plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons.",

The magnetopause moves inward to ~ 4 RE, and at the same time, the two cusps manifest as nearly parallel emission ridges in X-Ray. As the interplanetary magnetic field reverses, the cusp ridges move to higher latitudes for ~ 10 minutes after the reversal.

      "summary": "In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations.",

Combining the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism with the generalized coset construction, we formulate a symmetry-based effective action that incorporates both conservative and dissipative effects. The effective theory implements the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry, ensuring consistency with the fluctuation-dissipation relation and Onsager's reciprocal relations. Within this framework, we derive the entropy current associated with dissipative photon dynamics and demonstrate the non-negativity of its divergence, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. We also clarify the symmetry origin of the gauge redundancy in the unbroken phase within the Schwinger-Keldysh framework, relating it to strong and weak realizations of higher-form symmetries. Our results provide a model-independent effective description of photon dynamics in insulating media at finite temperature.",

Our goal here is to find simple UV-complete models that can realize potentially large neutrino-DM interactions, while being consistent with all existing theoretical and experimental constraints. We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrino-DM scattering in a low-energy effective theory with neutrinos and DM (DM-LEFT), together with its gauge-invariant embedding in the Standard Model EFT (DM-SMEFT). We then construct all renormalizable tree-level UV completions that generate the relevant DM-SMEFT operators up to dimension-8 using a topology-based classification. Using this framework, we present minimal UV-complete models for different DM types that can yield effective neutrino-DM couplings up to several orders of magnitude larger than the Fermi coupling, while satisfying all constraints, most notably from neutrino mass and from the charged-lepton sector. This includes a pseudo-Dirac fermion DM realization in the scotogenic neutrino mass model and models of Majorana DM inspired by type-II and inverse seesaw-based neutrino mass models. Phenomenological implications for DM thermal relic abundance and direct detection prospects, as well as various cosmological and laboratory constraints on the model parameter space, are also analyzed.",

Parity symmetry is spontaneously broken in the model, which helps in solving the strong CP problem without the axion. The Higgs sector of the model is very simple, consisting of a single pair of $H_L(2,1,4)+ H_R(1,2,4)$ fields. Fermion masses arise through mixing of the chiral fermions with vector-like quarks and leptons contained in $(1,1,15)$ as well as $(1,1,10)_L+(1,1,10)_R$ multiplets via a universal seesaw mechanism. Consistency of such a spectrum with the observed quark and lepton masses is established. The parity solution to the strong CP problem is shown to be effective in this framework, although there are new loop contributions to $\\overline\u03b8$, compared to the analogous left-right symmetric model, arising from color sextet and octet fermions, as well as from diagrams mediated by leptoquark bosons. We also find that, in this setup, although lepton number is broken, neutrino masses remain zero at the tree-level. Small and finite Majorana neutrino masses are induced via one-loop diagrams, which we analyze and show to be compatible with oscillation experiments.",

By contrast, the influence of another coefficient $\u03c4$ is more concentrated in regions away from the critical point.

We demonstrate that the non-perturbative treatment is essential, at least at lowest order, in the SU(3) sector of $KN$ scattering. Our NLO study achieves a good description of the empirical $s$-wave phase shifts in the isospin $I=1$ channel. An analysis of the effective range expansion yields a negative effective range, consistent with some partial wave analyses but opposite in sign to earlier phenomenological summaries. For the $I=0$ counterpart, the $KN$ interaction is found to be rather weak and exhibits large uncertainties. Further low-energy $KN$ scattering experiments and lattice QCD simulations are needed to better constrain both $s$-wave channels.",

The resulting thermodynamic pressure increases with temperature but exhibits an approximately logarithmic dependence. This is expected, as this is the de-confined phase of QGP; it is not exactly an ideal gas due to self-interaction.

We observe that the equation of state parameter shows quintessence-like behaviour during present and future epochs; however, phantom-like behavior is also possible for suitable values of the model parameters. Analysis of the deceleration parameter shows a smooth recent phase transition of the universe (deceleration to acceleration). An interesting result we observe is the decelerated expansion of the universe in the far future, i.e, the universe experiences another phase transition in the future. The physical significance of the well-known cosmological plane ($w_D-w_D'$ plane) is discussed in our model. We observe that the trajectories start in the freezing region with the same initial behavior, deviate from each other during the evolution and ends in the thawing region. Finally, we perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis and demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied within the present interacting ghost dark energy model.",

      "summary": "Within a generally covariant Hamiltonian framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), two black hole models parameterized by a quantum correction $\u03b6$ have recently been constructed. Using extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as high-precision probes, we investigate the imprints of this LQG deformation in the surrounding spacetime. Waveforms generated via an improved augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model in both LQG-BH backgrounds and in Schwarzschild spacetime are compared through a faithfulness analysis. This allows us to quantify the detectability of the deviation with LISA and to derive constraints on $\u03b6$ based on a detection threshold. We find that the first LQG-BH model produces significantly stronger signatures in EMRI signals than the second, making its quantum gravity effects more accessible to future space-borne gravitational-wave detection.",

        "Kristina Giesel",

      "summary": "The absence of Birkhoff's theorem in effective quantum gravity models leads to a fundamental ambiguity in the vacuum sector, where a priori no unique vacuum solution exists. As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework.",

      "summary": "With an intent to examine the combined effect of non-linear electrodynamics (NED) and dark matter (DM), we obtain a static and spherically symmetric solution with the black hole (BH) magnetically charged and immersed in the Hernquist DM halo (MHDM). The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $\u03b1$, $\u03b2$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring. Interestingly, we find combinations of charge and halo parameters that leave the deflection angle unchanged from the Schwarzschild case, thereby leading to a situation where an MHDM BH and a Schwarzschild BH become indistinguishable. Similar results are also observed for lensing observables. Finally, utilizing observations related to the angular diameter of super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ and employing the $\u03c7^2$ test, we extract bounds on $g$, $\u03b1$, and $\u03b2$ signifying the viability of our BH model as an SMBH.",

It is known that the continuum partition function can be represented by a Hermitian two-matrix model, and we propose a string field theory whose Dyson-Schwinger equation coincides with the loop equation of this continuum matrix model. By setting the matrix size to one, we analyze a convergent non-perturbative partition function expressed as a two-dimensional integral, and show that it satisfies a third-order linear differential equation. In contrast, in the absence of coupling to the critical Ising model, the continuum partition function of pure BPs with loops is known to satisfy the Airy equation. From the viewpoint of two-dimensional quantum gravity, we introduce a non-perturbative loop amplitude that serves as a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation incorporating contributions from all genera. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same Wheeler-DeWitt equation can also be derived through the stochastic quantization.",

In addition to the well-known Sagnac phase shift, we identify an additional contribution originating from a relative rotation in the polarization vectors. We formulate this effect as a gravitational holonomy associated to the internal Lorentz group. The magnitude of both effects is computed due to gravitational waves generated by a localized source far from the detector, at leading order in the inverse distance. For freely falling observers, the phase shift is zero and the polarization rotation becomes the dominant effect.",

The quantum zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint, obtained from a perturbative gauge-invariant canonical analysis, is explicitly imposed on a class of quantum states whose wavefunctions factorize into a background and a perturbative part, related through a geometric relational variable. These states naturally describe regimes with small perturbative backreaction and lead to an effective Hamiltonian and associated dynamics for the perturbations. The resulting equations take the form of Regge-Wheeler equations modified by expectation values of the quantum black hole geometry, providing a clear characterization of quantum corrections to the classical description of the black hole interior. This framework opens the way to investigating hybrid loop quantum gravity effects in the propagation of gravitational waves.",
