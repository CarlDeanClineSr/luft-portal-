      "summary": "On 2025 January 10, a thermonuclear (Type I) X-ray burst from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary \\textit{4U~0614+091} was detected with the ECLAIRs instrument on board the \\textit{SVOM} mission. We present here a time-resolved spectroscopic analysis of the burst, along with the detection of burst oscillations within a 51-second interval during the decay phase. The oscillation frequency is measured to be $\u03bd= 413.674 \\pm 0.002\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, consistent with previous reports. However, we detect a significant downward frequency drift over the burst duration, characterized by $\\dot\u03bd = (-4.7 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz\\,s^{-1}}$. This frequency evolution is atypical compared to those observed in similar burst oscillation sources. We tentatively attribute the observed drift to a Doppler shift induced by orbital motion. Under this interpretation, the inferred orbital period must be shorter than 20 minutes, placing \\textit{4U~0614+091} among the most compact known low-mass X-ray binaries.",

      "summary": "The accurate computation of quasinormal modes from rotating black holes beyond general relativity is crucial for testing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. In this study, we assess the accuracy of the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting the quasinormal mode spectrum of a scalar field on a deformed Kerr spacetime. To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation.",

In this regime, electrons can reach relativistic velocities. We extend linear theory to the nonlinear regime, showing that plasma waves can reach the wave-breaking limit. Perfectly collimated drivers produce wakes propagating at the speed of light, allowing electron phase-locking (limited by driver depletion). Non-collimated drivers induce subluminal phase velocities, limiting acceleration via dephasing. Two-dimensional simulations reveal unique transverse fields compared to laser wakefields, with a DC magnetic field leading to consistent focusing. The work considers observational prospects in laboratory and astrophysical scenarios such as around highly luminous compact objects (e.g., pulsars, gamma-ray bursts) interacting with tenuous interstellar or intergalactic plasmas, where conditions favor Comptondominated wakefield acceleration.",

      "summary": "Formation of a rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (NS) may occur in various classes of core-collapse events. If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on multidimensional numerical studies, we construct a minimal semi-analytic framework to follow the post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, map the blowout conditions by scanning the ejecta and NS parameters, and compute survey-ready multi-band light curves. For stripped-envelope SNe with an ejecta mass of $M_\\mathrm{ej} \\sim 10\\,M_\\odot$ and an explosion energy of $E_\\mathrm{sn} \\sim 10^{51}\\,\\mathrm{erg}$, blowout occurs for NSs with magnetic field strengths of $B_{\\mathrm{dip}} \\gtrsim 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ and spin periods of $P_\\mathrm{NS} \\lesssim \\mathrm{a\\ few}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Relatively weak-field cases with $B_\\mathrm{dip} \\lesssim 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ produce luminous double-peaked UV/optical light curves, as observed in the superluminous SN LSQ14bdq, while stronger-field cases with $B_\\mathrm{dip} \\gtrsim 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ result in hypernovae preceded by X-ray blowout precursors. We also examine weaker and lower-mass SN explosions representing ultra-stripped SNe and accretion- or merger-induced collapse events, in which blowout is more readily achieved over a broader range of NS parameters, producing fast X-ray transients with durations of $ 10^{2\\mbox{--}4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and peak luminosities of $10^{42\\mbox{--}48}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$. Our results encourage coordinated UV, optical, and X-ray observations which constrain the formation of the most energetic NSs in the universe.",

In a companion paper we discuss the structural parameters of such rotating stars under the influence of strong magnetic fields. We use the LORENE library to compute the structural parameters at different rotational frequencies in the range of 1100-1300~Hz for a non-magnetized SQS. While there is no minimum limit for the mass of slowly rotating self-bound stars, by computing the maximum rotational frequency, known as the mass-shedding limit, we show that SQS must have a minimum mass to sustain high rotational frequencies. The mass-shedding frequency in our EOS model is lower than that estimated from the MIT bag model EOS with a fixed bag constant. The Keplerian frequency in our model depends linearly on the gravitational mass at the mass-shedding limit (and similarly on the minimum mass) with the slope of 0.08~${\\rm kHz}/M_\\odot$. We obtain mass limits aligned with the observational data for both the heaviest and the lightest observed pulsars.",

Employing the LORENE library, we calculate the structural parameters under different magnetic field strengths and rotational frequencies. Our models are compared in terms of maximum gravitational mass, deformation parameter, binding energy, and compactness. Our equation of state model demonstrates that the gravitational masses are higher than those computed using a MIT bag model with a fixed bag constant. We find the gravitational masses beyond $2.3 \\,M_\\odot$, which are compatible with the masses of observed compact objects, such as the ``black widow'' pulsar \\emph{PSR J0952-0607}, and the \\emph{GW190814} event detected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The deformation parameter and maximum gravitational mass of SQS are characterized by fitted functions accounting for variations in both magnetic field strength and rotational frequency.

      "summary": "Extragalactic jets are broadly classified into two categories based on radio observations: core-brightened jets, known as Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR I), and edge-brightened jets, classified as Type II (FR II). This FR dichotomy may arise due to variation in the ambient medium and/or the properties of the jet itself, such as injection speed, temperature, composition, magnetization, etc. To investigate this, we perform large-scale three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D-MHD) simulations of low-power, supersonic jets extending to kiloparsec scales. We inject a jet beam carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field into a denser, unmagnetized, and stratified ambient medium through a cylindrical nozzle. Our simulations explore jets with varying injection parameters to investigate their impact on morphology and emission properties. Furthermore, we examine jets with significantly different plasma compositions, such as hadronic and mixed electron-positron-proton configurations, to study the conditions that may drive transitions between FR I and FR II morphologies. We find that, under the same injection parameters, mixed plasma composition jets tend to evolve into FR I structures. In contrast, electron-proton jets exhibit a transition between FR I and FR II morphologies at different stages of their evolution.",

The observations, conducted at three different radio frequencies with the Nan\u00e7ay Radio Telescope (NRT) and Parkes Telescope (PKS) and five frequencies with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), enabled precise corrections for dispersion measure effects and scattering variations. After these corrections, the timing residuals showed an unmodeled periodic noise component with an amplitude of 340 ns. Our analysis yields upper limits on the GW strain from individual sources, constraining it to be below \\(1.9 \\times 10^{-14}\\) at 71 nHz and \\(2.3 \\times 10^{-13}\\) at 1 \\textmu Hz for average sky locations, while for optimal source locations the limits improve to \\(6.2 \\times 10^{-15}\\) and \\(8.9 \\times 10^{-14}\\) at the same frequencies, respectively.

      "summary": "Transient astronomy in the early Universe (z > 2) remains largely unexplored, lying beyond the rest-frame optical spectroscopic reach of most current observatories. Yet this regime promises transformative insights, with high-redshift transients providing direct access to the early Universe and enabling studies of how stellar populations and cosmology evolve over cosmic time. JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of ~133 arcmin^2 (~0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z < 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z > 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z > 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe.",

However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained.

We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\\pm~$5.5) $\\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate.",

      "summary": "Relativistic jets launched in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are widely accepted as the engines powering most of the population of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817.",

The chiral 3NF derived from the chiral effective field theory has been successful in $\\textit{ab initio}$ studies of atomic nuclei. However, challenges remain, such as parameterizing low-energy constants and applying regulators. Most of established chiral nuclear forces have a nonlocal form in the momentum space. In this work, we construct local and hybrid local-nonlocal chiral 3NFs for the newly established Idaho local position-space two-nucleon potential, and calculate binding energies and radii of nuclei up to $^{132}$Sn. The two low-energy constants of 3NF are constrained by the ground-state energies of $^3$H and $^{16}$O, as suggested in a recent work. The chiral Hamiltonian obtained with the local-nonlocal regulator can simultaneously reproduce the experimental ground-state energies and charge radii of nuclei over a large range from $^4$He to $^{132}$Sn.",

In addition to the traditional $\\ge$3-hit or $\\ge$4-hit coincidences to trigger recording air-shower events, ALPAQUITA records the counting rates of the $\\ge$1-hit and $\\ge$2-hit events (Any1 and Any2, respectively). We report a successful detection of a Forbush decrease occurred on 2024 May 10 caused by a passage of an interplanetary shock formed ahead of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection. The amplitude detected in the Any1 rate is 4.26$\\pm$0.33% at the median primary rigidity of 76GV which is consistent with the observations with the worldwide neutron monitor and muon detector networks. Under the assumption of a power-law rigidity spectrum, we renormalized the errors of the observed amplitude ($A_{obs}$) and fitted them as a function of the median primary rigidity ($R_{m}$) of each detector and observational method. The result $A_{obs} = (10.9\\% \\pm 0.9\\%) \\times (R_{m}/10\\,GV)^{-0.55 \\pm 0.07}$ exhibits a hard nature of this event. Our non-detection in the Any2 rate decrease constrains the amplitude with a 2$\u03c3$ upper limit to be 0.95% at 960GV. This marginally suggests an existence of a spectral softening between 100GV and 1000GV as also suggested by the Misato underground muon detector at 145GV. Although a strong geomagnetic storm was observed during this period, we conclude it does not impact our results. Our novel technique realizes a unique coverage to study the behavior of the Forbush decreases at the highest rigidity.",

      "summary": "With upcoming facilities capable of detecting photometric and gravitational wave signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, studying their long-term accretion-driven variability is timely. OJ287 is a bright, nearby ($z=0.3$), and well-studied candidate for a SMBH binary. As such, it is an excellent case study for how binary dynamics could influence observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) photometric variability. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of OJ287, using the code PHANTOM. We simulate two mass ratios: (i) M$_1$ $=$ 1.835$\\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ with M$_2$ $=$ 1.4$\\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\\odot$, (ii) M$_1\\approx$ M$_2$ ($\\sim10^{8}$ M$_\\odot$) along and (iii) control of a single SMBH and accretion disc. We find that the simulation with masses 1.835$\\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ and 1.4$\\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\\odot$ evolves consistently with the most currently accepted model of OJ287 as a precessing SMBH binary. The secondary's impacts with the disc result in the formation of spiral density waves and a corresponding $\\sim$10-20% increases in the mass accretion rate of the primary SMBH. The impact timings and the mass accretion rate spikes show quasi-periodic variability as a result of the precession of the secondary's orbit with intervals between impacts ranging from $\\sim$ 1 year to $\\sim$ 10 years. In the near-equal mass case, the disc of the primary becomes tidally disrupted after $\\sim$ 2 years. Consequently, the near-equal mass system with a period of 12 years is not a viable candidate for OJ287. This modeling provides insights into the potential signatures of SMBH binaries by both gravitational wave observatories and the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",

In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.",

      "summary": "Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.",

Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources.

These goals can require careful accounting of stochastic noise processes, but existing methods developed to achieve this in radio pulsar timing analyses cannot be immediately applied to the discrete gamma-ray arrival time data. To address this, we have developed a new method for timing gamma-ray pulsars, in which the timing model fit is transformed into a weighted least squares problem by randomly assigning each photon to an individual Gaussian component of a template pulse profile. These random assignments are then numerically marginalised over through a Gibbs sampling scheme. This method allows for efficient estimation of timing and noise model parameters, while taking into account uncertainties in the pulse profile shape. We simulated Fermi-LAT data sets for gamma-ray pulsars with power-law timing noise processes, showing that this method provides robust estimates of timing noise parameters. We also describe a Gaussian-process model for orbital period variations in black-widow and redback binary systems that can be fit using this new timing method. We demonstrate this method on the black-widow binary millisecond pulsar B1957+20, where the orbital period varies significantly over the LAT data, but which provides one of the most stringent gamma-ray upper limits on the GWB.",

We investigate discrete ejecta produced in state transitions of black hole X-ray binary systems as a potential source of cosmic rays, motivated by recent $>100$ TeV $\u03b3$-ray detections by LHAASO. Starting from MAXI J1820+070, we examine the multi-wavelength observations and find that efficient particle acceleration may take place (i.e. into a robust power-law), up to $\\sim2\\times 10^{16}\u03bc^{-1/2}$ eV, where $\u03bc$ is the ratio of particle energy to magnetic energy. From these calculations, we estimate the global contribution of ejecta to the entire Galactic spectrum to be $\\sim1\\%$, with the cosmic ray contribution rising to $\\sim5\\%$ at PeV energies, assuming roughly equal energy in non-thermal protons, non-thermal electrons and magnetic fields. In addition, we calculate associated $\u03b3$-ray and neutrino spectra of the MAXI J1820+070 ejecta to investigate new detection methods with CTAO, which provide strong constraints on initial ejecta size of order $10^7$ Schwarzschild radii ($10^{-5}$ pc) assuming a period of adiabatic expansion.",

The compliant regions are depicted accordingly. For a suitable range of the model parameters, the values obtained for the inflationary observables align with the most recent observations by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration and/or the Planck mission.",

      "summary": "Recent studies report a mild discrepancy between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements within the $\u039b$CDM framework. This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $\u03c4$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $\u03c4$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$\u03b1$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $\u03c4=0.0552^{+0.0019}_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $\u03c4=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $\u03c4$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $\u03c4$-$\u03a9_m$ plane and find a $2.4\u03c3$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $\u039b$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\u03a3m_\u03bd<0.0550\\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $\u03a3m_\u03bd=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild $2.2\u03c3$ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond $\u039b$CDM.",

      "summary": "Two of the most pressing challenges in cosmology are the persistent discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant, referred to as the Hubble tension, and the deficit of baryons in the local Universe, known as the missing baryon problem. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($\u03a9_{\\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$\u03a9_{\\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$\u03a9_{\\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $\u03a9_{\\rm b}$ better than ($1\\%$, $1\\%$) in the $\u039b$CDM model, ($1.5\\%$, $2\\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\\%$, $3.5\\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $\u03a9_{\\rm b}$ to better than ($1\\%$, $2\\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons.",

      "summary": "One of the key challenges in strong gravitational lensing cosmography is the accurate measurement of time delays between multiple lensed images, which are essential for constraining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $\u039b$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($\u03b8<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling.",

We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \\gtrsim 70 \\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $\u039b$CDM cosmology.

We consider two effective field theory approaches in the literature, relate them to the TATT model parameters and an extension to TATT that includes the velocity-shear (VS) parameter. We compare the impact of changing between NLA, TATT, and TATT+VS on the theoretical computation of the 3PCF using the best fit parameters and tomographic redshift distributions from Dark Energy Survey Year 3. We find that the TATT model significantly impacts the skewed triangle configurations of the 3PCF. Additionally, including the higher-order effects from TATT can introduce opposite effects on the two-point function and on the mass aperture skewness, damping the signal of the former while boosting the signal of the latter. We argue that a joint 2PCF+3PCF analysis with the TATT model can help break the degeneracy between its model parameters and provide more robust constraints on both cosmology and intrinsic alignment amplitude parameters. We show that typical values of order unity for the intrinsic alignment parameters introduce differences of around $10\\%$ between NLA and TATT predictions.",

      "summary": "We present observational constraints on the Bound Dark Energy Cold Dark Matter (BDE-CDM) model using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with Planck CMB data and Type Ia supernovae compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5). In BDE-CDM, dark energy originates from the lightest meson field within a supersymmetric SU(3) dark gauge group with $N_f = 6$ flavors, governed by an inverse power-law potential $V(\u03c6) = \u039b_{c}^{4+2/3} \u03c6^{-2/3}$. Unlike $\u039b$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, the dark energy sector contains no free parameters -- the condensation scale $\u039b_c$ and transition epoch $a_c$ are determined by gauge coupling unification constraints. The equation of state evolves from relativistic behavior ($w = 1/3$) before condensation through a kinetic-dominated stiff phase ($w \\simeq 1$), approaching $w_0 = -0.9298 \\pm 0.0003$ at present, with $w > -1$ maintained throughout cosmic history, avoiding phantom-regime instabilities. We obtain $\u039b_{c} = 43.93 \\pm 0.13$~eV and $a_c = (2.489 \\pm 0.007) \\times 10^{-6}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. The $w_0$-$w_a$ confidence contours are approximately 10,000 times smaller than those of $w_0w_a$CDM while achieving comparable fits, and remain stable across different supernova datasets. Statistical analysis yields $\u0394\\mathrm{DIC} = -6.77$ and $\u0394\\mathrm{AIC} = -8.97$ relative to $\u039b$CDM for BAO+DESY5, constituting strong evidence favoring BDE-CDM model. The model predicts distinctive signatures including 25\\% enhancement in the matter power spectrum at $k \\approx 4.3\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.

The strong scalar backreaction regime introduces an effective quartic term in the potential for the gauge field background that rapidly drives it to zero, accelerating the axion-gauge system decay.

In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes. By contrast, LGAs with high $E_{\\rm coupling}$ show a weaker polar anisotropy but an enhanced azimuthal anisotropy, with large-scale tracer haloes preferentially lying in the plane spanned by the halo pair and the orbital spin vector.

Sahyadri includes systematic variations of six cosmological parameters around Planck 2018 constraints, with seed-matched initial conditions enabling cosmological parameter derivatives. Each simulation evolves $2048^3$ particles in a periodic box of side length $200$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, yielding a particle mass of $m_{\\rm{p}} = 8.1 \\times 10^{7}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ in the fiducial Planck 2018 cosmology. This resolution enables robust identification of dark matter halos down to $M_{\\rm min} = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\\odot$, which represents a factor of $\\sim$25 improvement over the AbacusSummit suite, and is over two orders of magnitude better than the Quijote and Aemulus suites. We estimate that approximately 40% of DESI BGS galaxies at redshift $z < 0.15$ - roughly 1.6 million objects - reside in halos accessible to Sahyadri but beyond the reach of existing parameter-varying simulation suites. We demonstrate Sahyadri's capabilities through measurements of the matter power spectrum, halo mass function and power spectrum, and beyond 2-point statistics such as the Voronoi volume function and $k^{\\rm th}$ nearest neighbour statistics, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and significant sensitivity to $\u03a9_{\\rm m}$ variations. We implement a custom compression scheme reducing storage requirements by a factor of $\\sim$3 while maintaining sub-percent clustering accuracy. Key data products will be made publicly available.",

      "summary": "We propose a dynamical reinterpretation of axion misalignment as an emergent collective phenomenon. Drawing an explicit parallel between axion field dynamics and synchronization in coupled oscillator systems, we show that a macroscopic axion phase can arise dynamically from initially incoherent configurations through gradient-driven ordering in an expanding Universe. In this framework, the misalignment angle is not a fundamental initial condition but a collective variable that becomes well defined only once phase coherence develops. Using a simple lattice model, we illustrate how the collective phase is selected prior to the onset of axion oscillations, providing a dynamical basis for the standard misalignment picture. This perspective offers a new way of organizing axion initial-condition sensitivity, reframes anthropic small-angle arguments in terms of phase-ordering efficiency, and suggests a broader connection between fine-tuning and emergent collective dynamics in the early Universe.",

      "summary": "This thesis focuses on gravitational waves (GWs) that arise beyond linear order in cosmological perturbation theory. In recent years, scalar-induced GWs have attracted significant attention because they may serve as the observational signature of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. The formation of PBHs requires large density perturbations, which can naturally emerge in some models of inflation. When these large density fluctuations couple, they act as a source for scalar-induced GWs at second order. In this work, we extend the existing formalism by including linear tensor fluctuations as an additional source term. This gives rise to two new classes of second-order GWs: those sourced by scalar-tensor couplings (scalar-tensor induced GWs) and those quadratic in tensor modes (tensor-tensor induced GWs). We find that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes significant if first-order tensor modes are enhanced, whilst the tensor-tensor contribution remains subdominant. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs exhibits an unphysical enhancement in the UV limit when the primordial scalar power spectrum is insufficiently peaked. To investigate whether this can be resolved, we study third-order induced GWs and their correlation with primordial GWs. We find that this new contribution suppresses the overall signal but does not cancel the unphysical enhancement. Possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed and left for future work. Finally, we explore the effect of primordial scalar non-Gaussianity on the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs, building on previous results showing its impact on scalar-induced GWs.",

We considered relativistic corrections to the thermal SZ signal and implemented X-ray absorption by Galactic molecular hydrogen. The $\u03b7_T$ distribution has a mean of $1.01 \\pm 0.03$, with average changes of $8.1\\%$ and $2.7\\%$ when relativistic corrections and molecular hydrogen absorption are not included, respectively. The $\u03b7_T$ distribution is positively skewed, with the scatter mostly affected by cluster morphology: relaxed clusters are closer to unity and less scattered than mixed and disturbed systems.

      "summary": "Recent analyses of wide-area radio-galaxy surveys have reported a statistically significant excess in the cosmic number-count dipole, with an amplitude exceeding the purely kinematic expectation of the standard $\u039b$CDM model by a factor of $\\sim 3$--$4$, quoted at a significance level of up to $5.4\u03c3$. While residual observational systematics and local-structure effects cannot be definitively excluded, this result motivates the exploration of alternative physical interpretations beyond the minimal $\u039b$CDM framework. We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales.",

We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models -- coupled quintessence and coupled fluid -- against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$\u03c3$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $\u039b$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.",

To capture the impact of baryonic physics, cosmological simulations must model gas dynamics and a host of relevant astrophysical processes.

This extension incorporates sub-resolution models for chemical enrichment, black hole and star formation, AGN kinetic and thermal feedback, supernova-driven feedback, galactic winds, and metal-line cooling. We present an inference framework based on high-fidelity emulators to aid in model calibration against observational targets, e.g., the galaxy stellar mass function, radial gas density profiles, and the cluster gas fraction. The emulators are trained on simulation suites comprising 64 boxes with side-length $128\\,h^{-1}$Mpc and 16 boxes with side-length $256\\,h^{-1}$Mpc with $2\\times 512^3$ and $2\\times 1024^3$ particles, respectively.

      "summary": "The high value of the cosmic microwave dipole may be telling us that dark matter is macroscopic rather than a fundamental particle. The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub-population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable.",

The method forms ratios of BAO distances including the Hubble distance, the comoving angular diameter distance, and the volume-averaged distance, so that the sound horizon scale cancels, and then maps each observed ratio to an effective flat-$\u039b$CDM matter density parameter, $\u03a9_{\\rm M}^\u039b$, defined as the value of $\u03a9_{\\rm M}$ that reproduces the measured ratio within $\u039b$CDM. Flat $\u039b$CDM predicts that $\u03a9_{\\rm M}^\u039b$ should be independent of redshift and of the particular ratio used. For ratios involving the integrated distances, we associate them with well-defined effective line-of-sight redshift intervals based on the integral mean value theorem. We apply the test to BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release~1 and Data Release~2, propagating the full published BAO covariance matrices into all derived ratios and $\u03a9_{\\rm M}^\u039b$ constraints. Within current uncertainties, the inferred $\u03a9_{\\rm M}^\u039b$ values are broadly consistent with a redshift-independent constant, providing an internal consistency check of flat $\u039b$CDM that can be strengthened straightforwardly as BAO measurements improve.",

The scale factor grows monotonically but by a finite amount, while curvature invariants decay exponentially, leading to an asymptotically Minkowski spacetime without future singularities. We confront the full nonlinear background evolution with cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and find good agreement with current late--time expansion data, with a reduced chi--squared $\u03c7^2/\u03bd\\simeq0.52$.

Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\\frac{dF}{dR}>0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $\u039b$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $\u03c7^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.",

      "summary": "Nuclear fusion promises a nearly limitless energy source, but achieving breakeven-where fusion output exceeds input-requires extreme plasma conditions and complex confinement systems. Here we propose an alternative approach based on beam-target interactions, introducing a simple energy-based criterion that compares fusion energy generation with energy loss. By creating electron-free targets, stopping power is drastically reduced, enabling conditions where fusion energy surpasses beam energy deposition under practical scenarios. This approach offers a viable alternative pathway to fusion energy without high-temperature plasma confinement and warrants further experimental investigation.",

      "summary": "During Type III solar radio bursts, beam-driven upper-hybrid wave turbulence is converted into electromagnetic emissions at the fundamental plasma frequency and its harmonic, through a chain of various linear and nonlinear wave processes. In this work, we mainly investigate the relative roles and interplay of two key mechanisms: the nonlinear decay of Langmuir/$\\mathcal Z$-mode waves and their linear transformations on random density fluctuations and, in particular, their mode conversion at constant frequency into electromagnetic waves. Using two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations, we employ a diagnostic approach based on large ensembles of virtual satellites that record local waveforms, enabling detailed temporal and spatial characterization of wave processes in randomly inhomogeneous plasmas. This method allows robust statistical analysis and direct comparison with spacecraft observations. The study focuses on the dependence of wave dynamics on the average level of density fluctuations and the plasma magnetization. Our results quantify the occurrence rate of decay under varying physical conditions and demonstrate how developed plasma density turbulence can significantly alter the balance between nonlinear wave-wave interactions and linear wave transformations. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for electromagnetic emissions during type III radio bursts and strengthen the connection between numerical simulations and in situ solar wind measurements, offering a valuable framework for the interpretation of future space-based waveform observations.",

By analyzing long-exposure photographs of the electron beam trajectory, we reconstructed the helical motion and calculated the invariants under different magnetic field configurations. Our results verify the conservation of the longitudinal invariant ($J$) with a ratio of 0.98 between configurations. The magnetic moment ($\u03bc$) exhibited a coefficient of variation of approximately 7\\%, a deviation consistent with the presence of collisional effects in the tube.

To evaluate each configuration, we use a broad set of measures, including effective ripple, sensitivity of the Shafranov shift to changes in plasma beta, the prevalence of maximum-J trapped particles, and the Rosenbluth-Hinton residual, among others. This enables an exhaustive, thorough and quantitative characterization of the database. Statistical analysis and modern machine learning techniques are then employed to find correlations, and identify key descriptors and heuristics to help understand tendencies that govern the behaviour of numerical optimization.

We have performed analytical calculations to determine the growth rate of instability under both strongly coupled and weakly coupled dusty plasma regimes. These theoretical predictions are subsequently validated through molecular dynamics simulations, enabling the reproduction of the instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma. The instability in these cases ultimately causes mixing among the charged species.

Observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) of electrostatic waves suggest that electrostatic instabilities, including the ion-ion-acoustic instability (IIAI) frequently observed in the inner heliosphere, play an important role in plasma heating and particle acceleration. Aims. Our aim is to explore the application of single spacecraft diagnostics to the IIAI, in anticipation of application to the current missions operating in the inner heliosphere, e.g. PSP and Solar Orbiter. Methods. We apply the field-particle correlation (FPC) technique to fully kinetic simulations of IIAI. We characterize the conversion of energy between the electric field and particle species, allowing the differentiation between oscillatory and secular energy transfer to and from the particles and highlighting the role of resonant energy exchange. We then identify the characteristic IIAI signatures for the proton and electron distributions, and relate them to our previous knowledge of IIAI onset and energy exchange mechanisms. Results. Applying the FPC technique to our simulations run in parameters regime compatible with solar wind conditions, we have identified IIAI signatures that would enable efficient recognition of IIAI in observations. This task is left for future missions, since the time scale over which IIAI signatures develop is too fast for the sampling rates of current missions.",

Using a multi-component analytical model that incorporates the diffuse warm ionized medium together with localized H II regions, supernova remnants (SNR), and stellar-wind bubbles (SWB), we derive location-dependent coefficients governing KA dispersion and nonlinearity. The reductive perturbation method is applied to obtain Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, enabling the characterization of solitons under realistic astrophysical conditions. Numerical analysis demonstrates how superthermality, plasma $\u03b2$, temperature, and density gradients modulate soliton amplitude, width, and stability. Our results reveal distinct exclusion zones (EZs) for KA solitons in high-$\u03b2$ HII regions and SWB/SNR interiors, as well as ultra low-$\u03b2$ regions near central pulsar wind nebulae. While H II regions exhibit simple Gaussian-driven depletions, the complex ``hole-and-shell\" morphologies of SWBs and SNRs imprint sharp spatial variations and discontinuities on soliton properties. This study establishes a direct link between macroscopic ISM morphology, ion-kinetic scale dissipation, and the emergence of coherent Alfv\u00e9nic activity, with implications for radio scattering, pulsar scintillation, and fine-scale signatures in astrophysical observations.",

While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\u03b7~\\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the \"frozen-in\" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.",

The probe consists of an ultrathin SiNx membrane (100 nm) with a lithographically defined Pt micro-strip (100 nm) that serves as a calibrated resistance thermometer. The sensor temperature can increase from room temperature to several hundred degrees within a second upon exposure to RF plasma, depending on the experiment's geometry and plasma parameters. Such sensitivity and response time are due to the pre-designed reduced heat capacity of the sensor and significantly reduced thermal conductance of the cooling channels. These features enable the sensitive detection of low-energy plasma fluxes on surfaces and their rapid discrimination, as in the case of ion and electron fluxes, by biasing the sensor at negative or positive potentials. These biased nanocalorimeter energy readings have been compared with ion and electron kinetic energy dissipations assessed using a Langmuir probe and retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA). Finally, the robustness of the plasma nanocalorimeter is discussed in terms of its baseline drifts, degradation, and longevity.",

In this work, we perform first-principles numerical simulations using the gyrokinetic, electromagnetic, global code ORB5 to study the effect of a self-consistent finite $\u03b2$ equilibrium on the arising Alfv\u00e9n Eigenmodes (destabilized by EPs), Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG), and Kinetic Ballooning Modes (KBM) microturbulence (destabilized by thermal species). Linearly, we explore the complex interplay between EP fraction, bulk gradients and a self-consistent Shafranov shift on the plasma stability. We choose single toroidal mode numbers to represent the system's instabilities and study the characteristic nonlinear evolutions of TAEs, KBMs and ITGs separately and including the axisymmetric field response to each mode separately. This study focuses on the impact of Shafranov shift equilibrium consistency, as well as the self-generated zonal ${E \\times B}$ flows, the saturation levels and resulting heat and particle fluxes. In the ITG cases including the $n=0$ perturbations reduces turbulent fluxes, as expected, however, for the TAE cases including the $n=0$ perturbations is shown to enhance the fluxes. We show for the first time that Axisymmetric Alfv\u00e9n Eigenmodes (AAEs) play a role in this mechanism.",

This interaction is mediated by a transient ablation pressure, whose complex spatio-temporal evolution remains experimentally inaccessible. Existing modeling approaches are limited: Empirical pressure-impulse models neglect dynamic plasma feedback, while advanced radiation-hydrodynamic codes often fail to resolve late-time droplet hydrodynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a radiation two-phase flow model based on a diffuse interface methodology. The model integrates radiation hydrodynamics for the plasma with the Euler equations for a weakly compressible liquid, extending a five-equation diffuse interface formulation to incorporate radiation transport, thermal conduction, and ionization. This formulation enforces pressure and velocity equilibrium across the diffuse interface region, with closure models constructed to ensure correct jump conditions at interfaces and asymptotically recover the pure-phase equations in bulk regions. Then, we apply the model to simulate a benchmark pre-pulse scenario, where a 50 micron tin droplet is irradiated by a 10 ns laser pulse. The simulations capture the rapid plasma expansion and subsequent inertial flattening of the droplet into a thin, curved sheet over microsecond timescales. Notably, the model reproduces experimentally observed features (such as an axial jet) rarely replicated in prior simulations. Quantitative agreement with experimental data for sheet dimensions and velocity validates the approach. The proposed model self-consistently couples laser-plasma physics with compressible droplet dynamics, providing a powerful tool for fundamental studies of plasma-liquid interactions in LPP-EUV source optimization.",

Varying the shape of this current waveform provides electrical control of the dynamics of the electric field in the plasma. Using sawtooth instead of sinusoidal waveforms allows breaking and controlling the temporal symmetry of the electric field dynamics. In this way CWT allows controlling the EEPF, the ionization-to-excitation rate ratio, and the plasma chemistry.",

Due to reduction of plasma resistivity after a certain level of plasma temperature, Ohmic heating becomes poor and further achievement of temperature needs other heating techniques. ADITYA-U tokamak is facilitated with a 42 GHz-500 kW Electron Cyclotron Resonant Heating (ECRH) system. Also, there is a Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system installed and operated at 3.7 GHz for driving non-inductive plasma current followed by the Ohmic current drive. Though an eventual impact in the rise of plasma temperature and plasma current due to the application of ECRH and LHCD respectively are very obvious, their energy coupling with the plasma results in several interesting outcomes in a number of experimentally measured plasma parameters. The present work addresses such impactful observations that are noticed and reported for the first time in ADITYA-U Tokamak.",

Using a fully-compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we quantify the subgrid-scale energy transfer and analyze its relationship to streamline structures by means of grandient tensor geometric invariants of the velocity field. Our results highlight how streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence: for nearly-incompressible fluctuations the energy is primarily transferred to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, while is back-transferred towards larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations, on the contrary, do not show a clear topological selection of the energy transfer since the overall direction of the local cascade rate is found to be determined by the sign of $-\\nabla\\cdot u$ (plasma volumetric compression or expansion).",

In this work, we extend previous studies to a broader range of EP temperatures, including the burning plasma regime and to wider variety of EP distribution functions. Two main stabilization mechanisms are found to be effective in ITG stabilization confirming previous studies: direct dispersion relation modification (DDRM) effective only at intermediate EP temperatures and dilution effect (DE) which is independent of EP temperature and becomes dominant in burning plasma regime ($T_f > 50T_i$). The study is further extended to slowing-down EP distributions which in contrast exhibit no DDRM-related stabilization. The findings are further validated in an ITER pre-fusion operation scenario and additionally compared with electromagnetic effects. In this scenario EP stabilization is found to be weaker than $\u03b2$-stabilization. Overall, these results provide better understanding of EP-ITG interactions over a wider range of EP parameters relevant to burning plasma regime which is important for predicting turbulence and confinement in future devices such as ITER.",

      "summary": "Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to avoid the well known gauge ambiguity of standard magnetic helicity in magnetically open domains. But its physical interpretation is difficult owing to the invocation of a reference field. For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona. These bounds confirm that both relative helicity and the unsigned helicity can influence the dynamics in the solar corona.",

We verify the role of this effect through particle-in-cell simulations of a modified Beltrami flow. Kineclinicity should be finite for all relativistic plasma systems due to the general lack of a functional relationship between fluid momentum and fluid velocity.",

There BISER originates from relativistic plasma singularities, so that the emission source size has a nanometer scale. The BISER x-ray yield quadratically depends on the driving laser power. BISER spectra have hundreds of electronvolt (eV) bandwidth embracing the 'water window' region (284 - 543 eV). Simulations predict that BISER pulses have durations close to the transform limit, which promises pulses shorter than the atomic unit of time (24 attoseconds). Based on the BISER brightness at ~20 terawatt laser power and the quadratic scaling, the brightness of BISER driven by petawatt-class lasers is predicted to exceed XUV free electron lasers. The BISER concept creates a new framework for a wide range of media emitting travelling waves capable of constructive interference, including gravitational waves. Here we review the BISER experimental discovery, its explanation based on the relativistic laser plasma simulations and catastrophe theory, experimental validation of the theoretical BISER model, proposal for imaging fast moving singularities, driving laser requirements, and future prospects emphasizing the driving laser wavelength scalability and possibility of terawatt attosecond coherent x-ray pulse generation.",

From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $\u03c9(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|\u03b4E_\\parallel|/|\u03b4B_\\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfv\u00e9nic to compressive fluctuations between $\\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|\u03b4E_\\parallel|/|\u03b4B_\\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.",

      "summary": "Why do we use nano-antennas for fusion? In three sentences: The present laser induced fusion plans use extreme mechanical shock compression to get one hotspot and then ignition. Still fusion burning spreads slower than expansion, and mechanical instabilities may also develop. With nano-antennas in radiation dominated systems, simultaneous ignition can be achieved in the whole target volume and there is no time left for mechanical instabilities. Ignition is achieved with protons accelerated in the direction of the nanoantennas that are orthogonal to the direction of laser irradiation.   Present laser fusion methods are based on extreme and slow mechanical compression with an ablator surface on the fuel target pellet to increase compression and eliminate penetration of laser electromagnetic energy into the target. This arises from a mistaken assumption, [1] that the detonation normal 4-vector should have vanishing time-like component, and this assumption eliminates the possibility to rapid or even simultaneous, radiation dominated detonations, (which are well known in the burning (or hadronization) of Quark Gluon Plasma).",

Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.",

      "summary": "Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.   Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.   The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.   The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.",

      "summary": "Accurate gas temperature ($T_{\\rm Gas}$) determination in microplasmas is critical for optimizing their applications, yet isolated diagnostic approaches may yield misleading results, especially under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Here, high resolution rotational spectra of N$_2$(C), OH(A), NH(A) and NO(A), generated in the plasma jet of a DC Ar/N$_2$ microhollow cathode discharge (MHCD), are recorded and their associated rotational temperatures ($T_{\\rm rot}$) are cross compared. A detailed experimental analysis and robust fitting of the rotational spectra are performed, achieving a reliable estimation of $T_{\\rm Gas}$. The dominant formation mechanisms of these species and their corresponding impact on rotational population distributions are also interrogated. Particularly, our findings indicate that the $T_{\\rm rot}$of N$_2$(C) is significantly influenced by energy transfers from argon metastables (Ar$^m$) and spectral interference from NH(A). This makes it unreliable as a thermometric probe in Ar-rich MHCD, unless complex analyses are employed. In contrast, OH(A) rotational population distribution appears to be less sensitive to Ar-induced perturbations across various discharge currents and pressures, providing more straightforward results. For all molecules considered, this study reveals the conditions under which all the measured $T_{\\rm rot}$ can be reliably considered to be in equilibrium with $T_{\\rm Gas}$. This highlights the importance of crossvalidating multiple thermometric probes and investigating relevant excitation kinetics when measuring $T_{\\rm rot}$ in reactive microplasmas.",

      "summary": "Magnetic switchbacks are fluctuations in the solar wind in which the interplanetary magnetic field sharply deflects away from its background direction so as to create folds in magnetic field lines while remaining of roughly constant magnitude. The magnetic field and velocity fluctuations are extremely well correlated in a way corresponding to Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations propagating away from the Sun. For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation. We identify and collate several open questions and recommendations for future studies.",

      "summary": "High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) offers considerable control over ion energy and flux, making it invaluable for tailoring the microstructure and properties of advanced functional coatings. However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies.",

The method is built around a finite volume formulation of the equations in which a Riemann solver is used to compute fluxes on the faces between grid cells, and a face-centered constrained transport formulation of the induction equation. The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. We present a thorough verification of the method and show that it converges at second order in the absence of discontinuities, and at first order with a discontinuity in material properties.",

For concreteness, we invoke deuterium-tritium (DT) as fuels. The intense electromagnetic field trapped inside the soliton significantly enhances the DT-fusion cross section, its ponderomotive potential evacuates electrons, and it accelerates D/T to kinetic energies suitable for fusion reaction. While electrons are expelled almost instantly, the much heavier D/T moves at picosecond time scale. Such a difference in time scales renders a time window for DT fusion to occur efficiently in an electron-free environment. We inject two consecutive lasers, where the first would excite plasma solitons and the second, much more intense and with a matched lower frequency, would fortify the soliton electromagnetic field resonantly. We impose a plasma density gradient to induce soliton motion. All D/T inside the plasma column swept by the moving soliton during its lifetime would participate in this fusion mechanism. We show that the breakeven condition is attainable. Invoking fiber laser and the iCAN laser technologies for high repetition rate and high intensity operation, gigawatt output maybe conceivable.",

      "summary": "Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.",

The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.",

Results demonstrated significant enhancement in germination index, chlorophyll content, and shoot root biomass compared to controls. PAW and ionic treatments notably increased the micronutrient content in grains, indicating effective biofortification. Soil microbial activity and enzyme assays showed no toxicity and a mild stimulatory effect due to reactive nitrogen species.

Recent observations have identified nanojets as small-scale (length $\\lesssim 6.6$~Mm, width $\\lesssim 1$~Mm), fast ($\\sim$~few 100 km s$^{-1}$), and short-lived ($\\lesssim 30$~s) ejections associated with nanoflare-scale energies, providing evidence of magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales. However, the lack of synthetic diagnostics has limited the connection between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and observations. In this Letter, we present synthetic observations of the coalescence of two flux ropes, leading to nanojet-like signatures from a numerical model obtained with the \\texttt{MPI-AMRVAC} code. We report synthetic observables in Extreme-ultraviolet lines compatible with existing instruments such as SDO/AIA, and upcoming MUSE mission, and compare the synthetic observables with an existing observation of nanojets. The synthetic diagnostics of the emissivity maps, Doppler velocity, thermal, and non-thermal line broadening produce key observational properties, suggesting a plausible 3D scenario for nanojet generation where tiny flux ropes reconnect within loops. Our results provide predictions for the detectability of nanojets with current and future spectroscopic facilities, and establish a bridge between MHD modeling and observations.",

      "summary": "The origin of non-thermal power-law distribution functions ubiquitously observed in astrophysical/space (e.g., the solar wind) and laboratory kinetic plasmas, is not well understood. Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $\u03ba= 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $\u03ba\\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $\u03ba\\to 1.5$ limit.",

This study explores the effects of CP and UV radiation on the germination, growth, and phytochemical profiles of alfalfa sprouts. CP significantly accelerated germination time, reducing median germination time by 8 hours compared to the control, and enhanced photo synthetic pigments, leading to higher biomass (25.87 mg/sprout fresh weight and 1.45 mg/sprout dry weight). UV treatments, particularly UV-C, increased chlorophyll and total flavonoid content.

Unlike standard nonlocal closures, this RKM uses the Fokker-Planck collision operator, therefore local transport results are naturally reproduced for small Knudsen number. An inhibited peak heat flux and preheat of the conductive heat flux are observed, which are expected from physical arguments and previous kinetic studies. Nonlocal behavior of other transport fluxes, namely the Righi-Leduc, Peltier, Ettingshausen, Nernst, thermal force, friction, cross friction, viscous stress, and gyroviscous stress terms are also demonstrated. Neglecting the nonlinear component of the Fokker-Planck collision operator is justified a posteriori. An especially computationally efficient and analytically simpler version of the RKM is presented.",

Here we propose a simple method to calculate the same using the in-situ data of multi-spacecraft systems. Unlike the popular Curlometer method which depends on the vector integration theorems, our integration-free method is based on the construction of a local orthonormal coordinate system and the associated finite difference approximations. The Curlometer is applicable to a four spacecraft system arranged in a tetrahedron and yields a single volume-averaged estimate of the curl. Using our proposed method over 107 intervals of MMS (NASA) data, on the other hand, we successfully calculate the spatial derivatives at the position of each spacecraft of the tetrahedron and a three-spacecraft (non-collinear) subset of the same. The average value of all the curls calculated for a given tetrahedron shows an excellent agreement (correlation coeffcient ~ 0:99) with the curls calculated using Curlometer formula. The quality of the calculated curl (using our method) is found to improve if the spacecraft configuration approaches a regular tetrahedron. The current framework facilitates investigation of turbulent heating rates and the exploration of local flow features like Beltramization, existence of current sheets, etc., in present and future multi-spacecraft mission, including those involving more than four spacecraft.",

      "summary": "A demonstrated failure mode for operational solar flare forecasting is the inability to forecast flares that occur near, or just beyond, the solar limb. To address this shortcoming, we develop a \"4pi\" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a \"visibility\" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far (\"invisible\" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or \"missed\" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources.",

      "summary": "Full-disk observations from missions such as the SDO and SOHO have enabled comprehensive studies of solar oscillations and dynamics. Interpreting helioseismic and photospheric data is complicated by systematic center-to-limb variations. To explore the physical origin of these variations, we perform local 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations that include effects of solar rotation to generate 24-hour synthetic time series of continuum intensity and Doppler velocity for nine viewing angles spanning from -75 to 75 degrees. The simulations reveal a systematic decrease in oscillation power toward the limbs and a pronounced East-West asymmetry that increases with frequency, primarily due to rotation-induced flows. With increasing angular distance from the disk center, the amplitudes and widths of the surface gravity (f) and resonant pressure (p) modes decrease. In contrast, the amplitudes of the corresponding pseudo-modes with frequencies above the acoustic cut-off frequency increase in the intensity power spectra but are suppressed in the velocity spectra. The local helioseismology ring-diagram analysis of the simulation data further demonstrates anisotropic broadening of the modes and distinct differences in background noise and pseudo-mode structure between the intensity and velocity data. These results indicate that the center-to-limb effects arise from both geometric projection and physical factors such as line-formation height and potential effects of the radial differential rotation. The findings provide a framework for correcting helioseismic observations and demonstrate that realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations are a powerful tool for disentangling geometric and physical biases in solar data.",

Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.",

A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.",

A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\u03b2$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.",

Such activity can pose significant operational challenges for critical infrastructure operators, particularly those managing electricity transmission networks, satellite constellations, and aviation systems. Substantial progress has been made in understanding space weather and the potential exposure of infrastructure assets to severe events. We have seen few evaluations of the types of current mitigation strategies in use to reduce our shared vulnerability to this activity, motivating this study. Firstly, we fill an important literature gap by undertaking a systematic review of the range of space weather mitigation strategies for these three critical infrastructure sectors. Secondly, we contacted 303 critical infrastructure operators (50 power, 227 satellite, 26 aviation) for participation in an anonymous online survey or interview receiving 55 unique responses (18% response rate). To capture narratives of mitigation actions taken and impacts experienced over the solar maximum, qualitative interviews were then conducted with 33 operators. The results identified 91 potential mitigation actions within the sectors and found that 149 mitigation actions were enacted due to space weather forecasts and experienced impacts. This is one of the first exhaustive studies of space weather mitigation activities, and moves beyond the traditional focus on purely impacts.",

About 20% of the events are quasi-laminar, showing single power-law spectra, whereas 80% are turbulent, exhibiting a spectral break separating inertial and kinetic ranges. A dawn-dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial-range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic-range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection-related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail-aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near -1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range. These results demonstrate that Mercury's unique plasma environment fundamentally reshapes the initiation of turbulence and the redistribution of energy in the magnetotail.",

      "summary": "Fast and slow solar wind have distinct properties linked to their solar sources.Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind complicates the usual speed-based classification, especially at intermediate speeds. Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfv\u00e9nic streams: one fast wind, three Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfv\u00e9nicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfv\u00e9nic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfv\u00e9nicity relates to the solar source conditions.",

      "summary": "In this letter, we investigate the population of energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves (SAWs) using more than 20 years of data provided by the Wind spacecraft near 1 au. We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

      "summary": "Mars lacks a global intrinsic dipole magnetic field, but its interaction with the solar wind generates a global induced magnetosphere. Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations.",

      "summary": "In solar wind turbulence, the energy transfer/dissipation rate is typically estimated using MHD third-order structure functions calculated using spacecraft observations. However, the inherent anisotropy of solar wind turbulence leads to significant variations in structure functions along different observational directions, thereby affecting the accuracy of energy-dissipation rate estimation. An unresolved issue is how to optimise the selection of observation angles under limited directional sampling to improve estimation precision. We conduct a series of MHD turbulence simulations with different mean magnetic field strengths, $ B_0 $. Our analysis of the third-order structure functions reveals that the global energy dissipation rate estimated around a polar angle of $ \u03b8= 60^\\circ$ agrees reasonably with the exact one for $ 0 \\le B_0/b_{rms} \\le 5 $, where $b_{rms}$ denotes the root-mean-square magnetic field fluctuation. The speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle can be understood by the Mean Value Theorem of Integrals, since the spherical integral of the polar-angle component ($\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$) of the divergence of Yaglom flux is zero, and $\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$ changes sign around 60$^\\circ$. Existing theory on the energy flux vector as a function of the polar angle is assessed, and supports the speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle. The angular dependence of the third-order structure functions is further assessed with virtual spacecraft data analysis. The present results can be applied to measure the turbulent dissipation rates of energy in the solar wind, which are of potential importance to other areas in which turbulence takes place, such as laboratory plasmas and astrophysics.",

To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and \u03b8_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.",

Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.",

There exists some ambiguity whether magnetodisc scattering or high-latitude Alfvenic acceleration best describes the observed properties of these injection signatures, and also to what extent arcs in the outer emission are related to injections. Many injection signatures are the result of the evolution of dawn storms; there is, however, limited evidence that non-dawn-storm injection signatures are sometimes present in the aurora. We use automatic detection of these discrete features, alongside data from Juno-UVS and in-situ measurements by other Juno instruments, to show that scattering likely accounts for most of the electron precipitation associated with injection signatures. Additionally, there is evidence that injection signatures can be classified into two types: dawn-storm and non-dawn-storm. Arc-like features in the outer emission show very similar properties to traditional blob-like injection signatures and may consist of sequences of injection signatures that have broadened into an arc via energy-dependent electron drift.",

      "summary": "A common occurrence in weakly collisional space plasmas is the unequal electron-ion temperatures. The pressure-strain interaction provides a mechanism-agnostic pathway for increasing plasma internal energy through spatiotemporally local isotropic compression and volume preserving deformation, yet its behavior under thermal disequilibrium is largely unexplored. We investigate this using five fully kinetic two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of undriven decaying turbulence by varying the initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio. By analyzing the species' internal energy density alongside a decomposition of the pressure-strain term, with a focus on the volume-preserving deformation that contains normal and shear contributions, we quantify how the initial temperature imbalance modifies the channels through which turbulence increases each species' internal energy density. The cumulative pressure-strain interaction tracks the change in internal energy for both electrons and ions, with the total deformation channel of energy conversion dominating. We discover that local changes to electron internal energy density are governed primarily by the shear deformation power density, concentrated in electron-scale current sheets, while the ion shear and normal deformation components cancel, yielding a much smaller net deformation power density that peaks around, rather than within, those electron-scale current structures. We find that the amplitudes and localization of deformation change, but preserve these qualitative trends. Together, these results show how thermal disequilibrium could shape species-dependent turbulent \"heating rate\", measured via pressure-strain interaction and approximated via only its shear deformation part, and provide a framework for interpreting energy evolution and conversion in space plasmas where unequal species temperature is the norm.",

SWPC selected a set of 38 historical events over the period of five years from 2012--2014 (33 events) and 2017--2019 (5 events). The overall three-year project consisted of multiple simulation validation studies for the entire event set (1292 simulations): (a) benchmark single map (operational version prior to May 2019) (b) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving WSA-ENLIL with 4 different model settings (c) single test simulation of a time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (d) single GONG map driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (e) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL. We report that for all 38 events, within each model version/settings combination, the CME arrival time error decreased by 0.2 to 0.9 hours when using a sequence of time-dependent zero-point corrected magnetograms compared to using single magnetogram input. Overall, for all events, when using the older uncorrected magnetograms, the CME arrival time error increased for all new model versions/settings combination compared to the benchmark. Notably for the 5 events in the period 2017--2019 when more reliable zero-point corrected magnetograms were available, the ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (median arrival realization) CME arrival time error decreased against all benchmarks. In this report we also discuss replicating the operational model, challenges in detecting CME arrival in simulations, and comparing zero-point corrected and uncorrected magnetogram inputs.",

We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.",

In this work, we built SEPNet, an innovative multi-task neural network that jointly predicts future solar eruptive events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and SEPs, incorporating long short-term memory and transformer architectures that capture contextual dependencies. SEPNet is a machine learning framework for SEP prediction that utilizes an extensive set of predictors, including solar flares, CMEs, and space-weather HMI active region patches (SHARP) magnetic field parameters. SEPNet is rigorously evaluated on the SEPVAL SEP dataset (whitman, 2025b), which is used to evaluate the performance of the current SEP prediction models. The performance of SEPNet is compared with classical machine learning methods and current state-of-the-art pre-eruptive SEP prediction models. The results show that SEPNet, particularly with SHARP parameters, achieves higher detection rates and skill scores while maintaining suitable for real-time space weather alert operations. Although class imbalance in the data leads to relatively high false alarm rates, SEPNet consistently outperforms reference methods and provides timely SEP forecasts, highlighting the capability of deep multi-task learning for next-generation space weather prediction.

      "summary": "A previously developed multi-ion, two-stream Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) hydrodynamic model for plasmasphere refilling has been extended to incorporate self-consistent electron temperature evolution. The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms.",

      "summary": "Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observes abundant circularly polarized ion-scale waves throughout the inner heliosphere. These waves are a signature of the interplay between plasma microinstabilities and turbulent dissipation. We perform a mission-wide statistical survey of ion-scale waves observed by PSP, investigating if the waves correspond to specific free energy sources in the measured proton velocity distributions. We find that left-handed waves (LHWs) are frequently observed, with the fraction of time they are observed increasing closer to the Sun, reaching $\\sim$30\\%. Right-handed waves (RHWs) are less frequently observed, with the associated time fraction decreasing closer to the Sun. The observed LHWs are generally consistent with parallel propagating ion cyclotron wave (ICW) storms that occur continuously for extended periods of time. Turbulent energy spectra are consistently steeper when LHW storms are observed; these wave storms mediate the spatial transport of the free energy associated with temperature anisotropy. The observed RHWs are generally consistent with oblique and parallel fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs), and their observation is well correlated with enhanced proton parallel heat flux, which quantifies the presence of secondary proton populations. Using observations and the SAVIC machine learning instability identification algorithm, we identify a threshold on the proton heat flux beyond which FMWs are likely to be driven unstable by the proton beams. We are thus able to associate trends in the observed ion-scale waves with known sources of free energy for Encounters 3 through 24 of the PSP's prime science phase.",

      "summary": "Quantum computing qubits are notoriously fragile, requiring extreme isolation from environmental disturbances. This paper advances the hypothesis that a combination of microgravity and ultra-low temperature (near absolute zero) provides an almost \"ideal\" operating environment for quantum hardware. Under such conditions, gravitational perturbations, thermal noise, and vibrational disturbances are minimized, thereby significantly extending qubit coherence times and reducing error rates. We survey four leading qubit platforms - superconducting circuits, trapped ions, ultracold neutral atoms, and photonic qubits - and explain how each can benefit from a weightless, cryogenic setting. Recent experiments support this vision: Bose-Einstein condensates on the International Space Station (ISS) maintained matter-wave coherence far longer than on Earth, atomic clocks in orbit achieved record stability, and a photonic quantum computer deployed in space is demonstrating robust operation. Finally, we outline a proposed side-by-side experiment comparing identical quantum processors on the ground and in microgravity. Such a test would directly measure improvements in qubit coherence (T1, T2), gate fidelity, and readout accuracy when the influence of gravity is removed.",

      "summary": "Venus, in the absence of an intrinsic magnetic field, undergoes a direct interaction between its ionosphere and the solar wind. Previous missions, including Mariner, Venera, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), reported a recurring localized increase in electron density, often termed a \"bulge,\" at altitudes between 160 and 200 km. This study investigates this topside bulge using over 200 dayside electron density profiles derived from the Venus Radio Science experiment (VeRa) onboard the Venus Express (VEX). We employ an automated, gradient-based classification algorithm to provide a quantitative and reproducible method for identifying and categorizing the bulge morphology into three types. Type 1 profiles exhibit a distinct secondary peak above the main V2 layer. Type 2 profiles display a shoulder-like feature near the bulge altitude. Type 3 bulges are not visually apparent but can be identified through residuals obtained after subtracting a Chapman layer fit to the V2 peak. The bulge is detected in over 80\\% of the analyzed profiles, with a higher occurrence during periods of low solar activity and at lower solar zenith angles (SZA). Type 1 morphologies are only observed at low latitudes (within $\\pm 40^\\circ$). The peak altitude of the bulge negatively correlates with SZA, suggesting that thermospheric cooling toward the terminator significantly influences the bulge altitude. The occurrence patterns and morphological characteristics indicate that the bulge is likely influenced by external drivers, such as solar wind interaction, rather than being solely a result of local photochemical processes.",

To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\\perp/T_\\|\\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs. Finally, this paper underscores the importance of high-resolution observations of the solar wind velocity distributions around RDs.",

This study investigates how Landau damping modifies the nonlinear evolution of KAWs by solving a modified nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation that captures both dispersive and nonlinear effects. Without Landau damping, modulational instability drives rapid self-focusing into intense magnetic filaments, producing a turbulent cascade with $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling in the inertial range ($k_\\perp\u03c1_i<1$) that transitions to $k_\\perp^{-8/3}$ at sub-ion scales ($k_\\perp\u03c1_i>1$), here $k_\\perp$ is the wavevector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field and $\u03c1_i$ the ion thermal gyroradius. When Landau damping is included, magnetic structures are significantly suppressed, and the spectrum steepens to $k_\\perp^{-11/3}$ in the sub-ion range while the inertial range maintains $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling. The damping acts across all scales through resonant wave-particle interactions, efficiently transferring energy from waves to particles. Direct comparison with Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations shows that the observed kinetic range spectral slope falls between our undamped and damped simulation limits, consistent with an intermediate damping regime in magnetosheath turbulence. This agreement confirms that Landau damping is one of the primary mechanisms controlling turbulent energy dissipation at kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas.",

Our investigation, preparing for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from beyond 35\u00b0 elongation are used.

We obtain the magnetic catalysis behavior for a phase transition between DW and horizon configuration of the string. The structure of the phase diagram does not depend on the boundary conditions choice for the dilaton field. Inclusion of the external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy enhance the string tension in the horizon configuration, namely drag force. For the spatially isotropic case $\u03bd= 1$ at different magnetic field values the string tension is proportional to $T^2$ and is qualitatively consistent with lattice results.

Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information--theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.",

To achieve this, we first derive a mapping between the partial wave expansion and the EFT expansion to all orders. We find that at lower orders, EFT predicts correlations between the different partial wave coefficients. This allows us to construct linear combinations of partial wave coefficients that get their leading contributions from a higher dimension EFT operator. We then introduce experimental observables, the so called angular moments -- that probe these linear combinations of partial wave coefficients -- and can be determined from a fully differential analysis of the angular distribution of the leptons arising from the $Z$ decay. We show that analysing the dependence of these angular moments on the $Zh$ invariant mass allows us to systematically probe all higher dimension EFT operators contributing to this process. While we take the Higgs-strahlung process as an example, the methods developed here are completely general and can be applied to other 2-to-2 collider processes.",

      "summary": "Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson, Fischler and Susskind, and particularly Bousso suggested that, in the quantum theory of gravity, this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made by Fischler and one of the present authors. Leutheusser and Liu showed that, in the $N = \\infty$ limit, causal diamonds with finite area in AdS radius units had Type $III_1$ von Neumann sub-algebras of the full operator algebra. They claimed that this was true for finite values of the UV cutoff, and that the algebra was the algebra of bulk local fields in the diamond. We will argue that the second part of this conjecture is incorrect and that the bulk field algebra emerges only in a double scaled limit, where the boundary UV cutoff is taken to infinity as $N$ is taken to infinity. There is never a bulk field theory description that resolves distances smaller than the AdS radius.",

Based on Nash's embedding theorem, the model introduces orthogonal perturbations via variations in the extrinsic curvature, generating scalar-type metric perturbations directly from geometry, without the need to introduce additional fields. We confront the model with current observational data, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, and recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) compilations. Our analysis shows that Nash gravity provides a good fit to the data, yielding a slightly higher value for the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 69.32 \\pm 0.72$ km/s/Mpc, compared to the $\u039b$CDM model, thus offering a potential alleviation of the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, the model naturally predicts a suppressed growth of structure, with $S_8 \\approx 0.76$ across various joint analyses, potentially alleviating the so-called $S_8$ tension, assuming that this discrepancy is not solely due to systematic effects in other independent measurements. In some cases, Nash gravity achieves a better fit to the data than the $\u039b$CDM paradigm at the $2\u03c3$ level.",

Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon. Possible implications for primordial black holes and some astrophysical applications, as well as extensions to higher dimensions, are also discussed.",

Once these potentials are determined, the corresponding non-perturbative amplitudes in the classical limit are obtained by iterative insertions and subsequently translated into gravitational waveforms using the KMOC formalism. As an application, we compute the gravitational waveform emitted by a two-body system moving along a generic, potentially highly bent, trajectory. Importantly, our formalism extends effective field theory matching of the gravitational two-body potential to radiative phenomena, enabling the extraction of gravitational-wave source terms directly from perturbative on-shell scattering amplitudes.",

Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter.",

Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders.",
