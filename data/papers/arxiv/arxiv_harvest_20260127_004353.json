      "summary": "Gravitational waves (GWs) in the $10^{-3}-0.1$ Hz band encode unique signatures of the early universe and merging compact objects, but they are beyond the reach of existing observatories. Theoretical models suggest that the Moon could act as a resonant detector, but the unknown influence of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior has cast doubt on this prospect. Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns. This dual-methodology approach not only recovers the expected predominant quadrupole ($l=2$) oscillation mode, but also exposes a systematic signal amplification of $(10-20)\\%$ in thick-crust regions. This enhancement is traced by our normal-mode analysis to a mode-coupling process, in which the original quadrupolar oscillation induced by the passing GWs distributes energy into a series of higher-order modes, the hybridized eigenmodes of the laterally heterogeneous Moon. Near certain eigen-frequencies and at specific locations, we observe up to tenfold amplification, highlighting the power of numerical simulations in resolving these structurally fine-tuned features. Our work establishes the Moon as an accurately calibrated resonant GW detector, and the resulting amplification maps provide quantitative guide for the optimal landing site selection.",

      "summary": "Detection of stellar flares at hard X-ray is still rare at the current stage. A transient was recently detected by the hard X-ray camera, ECLAIRs onboard the SVOM mission at 11:39:01.2UT on 2025, January 09. Simultaneous monitor in the optical band on the ground by SVOM/GWAC and follow-up spectroscopy enable us to confirm that the transient is caused by a superflare on HD~22468, a RS CVn-type star. The bolometric energy released in the flare is estimated to be $\\sim7.2\\times10^{37}-1.7\\times10^{38}\\ \\mathrm{erg}$. The hard X-ray spectra of the event at the peak can be reproduced by the ``apec'' model of a hot plasma with a temperature of $106^{+27}_{-22}$~MK. In the optical range, the H$\u03b1$ emission-line profile obtained at $\\sim1.7$ hrs after the trigger shows a bulk blueshift of $-96\\pm20\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}}$, which can be explained by either a chromospheric evaporation or a prominence eruption.

      "summary": "Tilted accretion disks in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state may be present in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei such as Sgr A* and M87. We have carried out 3D global GRMHD simulations to study the evolution of these accretion flows as a function of black hole spin and misalignment angle. Prograde MADs align with the spin through a two-stage process: an initial rapid alignment phase that operates on the magnetic flux saturation timescale, followed by a slower, spin-independent phase. In contrast, retrograde MADs remain persistently misaligned regardless of the black hole spin, displaying solid-body precession at rates four times higher than weakly magnetized flows at the same spin magnitude. By deriving torque equations in ideal GRMHD and evaluating them in a frame aligned with instantaneous disk orientation, we demonstrate that electromagnetic (EM) torques always act to align the disk with the BH spin, but are countered by opposing hydrodynamic fluxes in retrograde flows. We further develop a preliminary empirical model to explain the cause of two-stage prograde alignment and discuss the possibility of alignment in the retrograde MAD. Strongly magnetized, retrograde, misaligned accretion disks provide a candidate scenario for the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in black hole X-ray binaries.",

This rapid variability provides the opportunity to quantify intrinsic variability and separate time-variable emission features from stable signatures of strong gravity and the accretion environment. To infer the properties \\sgra and its surrounding accretion flow, we perform Bayesian inference on a series of EHT data segments (``snapshots''). We directly fit parameters of a semi-analytic emission model jointly with complex station gains to snapshot visibilities, then extract estimates of the time-averaged, persistent source structure and temporal variability by stacking snapshots in a Bayesian hierarchical model. This approach successfully reproduces parameters of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics simulations using synthetic EHT observations. Even with physically motivated assumptions about the \\sgra environment, black hole spin and magnetic field parameters are poorly constrained by 2017 EHT observations. Our inference constrains other parameters, favoring a nearly face-on observer inclination ($\u03b8_{\\rm o} = 9.2\\degree \\pm 3.6 \\degree \\pm_{\\rm v} 11.6\\degree$), an emission peak near the horizon ($R_{\\rm peak} = 4.9 \\pm 0.1 \\pm_{\\rm v} 0.5\\,GM/c^2$), near-vertical projected spin position angle ($p.a. = 7.3\\degree \\pm 7.08 \\degree \\pm_{\\rm v} 43.5\\degree$ counterclockwise from vertical), and dominant emission $43.4\\degree \\pm 2.0\\degree \\pm_{\\rm v} 5.9\\degree$ above the equatorial plane, where we separate average structure uncertainty ($\\pm$) from the impacts of temporal variability and model misspecification ($\\pm_{\\rm v}$).",

      "summary": "Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($<$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($<$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\\sim 1-2.5\\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.",

The enhanced mass-loss in the [WR] models leads to an accelerated post-AGB evolution and a subsequent delay in hot bubble formation compared to their H-rich counterparts, as suggested by a previous work. By computing synthetic X-ray spectra that account for the mixed H-rich and H-deficient gas phases, we find that models incorporating [WR] winds exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities ($L_\\mathrm{X}$) than their H-rich counterparts, but the emissivity-weighted plasma temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas converge to values of $T_\\mathrm{X} = [1-3] \\times 10^{6}$~K, regardless of whether the system follows a [WR]-type or an H-rich post-AGB evolutionary path.

We investigate light DPs kinetically mixed with the visible photon that need not be the dark matter, focusing on resonant photon-DP oscillations in magnetized, modeled plasma environments. We show that realistic non-monotonic plasma density profiles generically enhance resonant conversion relative to monotonic models, leading to substantially stronger constraints on the photon-DP kinetic mixing parameter ($\u03b5$). Using spectral data from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87*, extending to the LOFAR band, we derive a bound $\u03b5\\simeq 7\\times10^{-6}$ at the DP mass $m_{A'} \\simeq 5\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation distance $3r_{\\rm ph}$, where $r_{\\rm ph}$ denotes the photon sphere radius.

We derive a directionality factor arising from the relative bulk motion between the neutrino medium and plasma, and show that it can produce an anomalous frequency dependence of the polarization-rotation angle, distinct from the $\u03c9^{-2}$ scaling of Faraday rotation. This anomalous scaling can occur either at the resonance plasma frequency condition $\u03c9\\simeq \u03c9_p$, or when $E_\u03bd^{0}\\simeq m_\u03bd\u03c9/\u03c9_p$ lies within the range of the neutrino energy spectrum. We estimate the effect for three scenarios: jets propagating through the cosmic neutrino background (C$\u03bd$B), jets with an internal flux of high-energy neutrinos, and accretion-disk plasma permeated by the C$\u03bd$B. Of the three scenarios, the latter gives the largest rotation angle $\u03c6_{\\rm d} \\sim 10^{-35}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$, at X-ray frequencies.

Concentrating on four different spinning configurations, we find that aligned, anti-aligned, and mixed (aligned/anti-aligned) spin configurations lead to markedly different growth rates of the electromagnetic (EM) energy, field topologies, and vortex properties when compared to the irrotational case. These differences arise from intrinsic variations in the system dynamics, such as tidal deformation, collision strength, and contact surface area, with the anti-aligned configuration producing the largest vorticity and growth in EM energy. Importantly, while different spin configurations lead to significantly different initial growth rates of the poloidal/toroidal components, all systems converge to a specific topological partition. Our simulations are confined to a short window in time, but the different EM energies produced as a result of spin will imprint the EM emission at merger and provide information on the spinning state at merger.",

The relationship of this scenario with permanent torque-changing glitches seen in the Crab and other young pulsars, and a set of similar events in the same object and others is addressed.

The $\\sim3$ pc scale wide-angle radio and X-ray emitting caps found around Cir X-1 are identified as synchrotron emitting shocks with significant proper motion and morphological evolution on decade timescales. Proper motion measurements of the shocks reveal they are mildly relativistic and decelerating, with apparent velocity of $0.14c\\pm0.03c$ at a propagation distance of 2 pc. We demonstrate that these shocks are likely powered by a hidden relativistic ($\\gtrsim0.3c$) wide-angle conical outflow launched in $1972\\pm3$, in stark contrast to known structures around other XRBs formed by collimated jets over 1000s of years. The minimum time-averaged power of the outflow required to produce the observed synchrotron emission is $\\sim0.1L_\\text{Edd}$, while the time-averaged power required for the kinetic energy of the shocks is $\\sim40 \\left(\\frac{n}{10^{-2} \\text{cm}^{-3}}\\right)L_\\text{Edd}$, where $n$ is the average ambient medium number density.

      "summary": "We present serendipitous simultaneous radio and X-ray light curves of the dwarf Seyfert galaxy UGC 6728 spanning 5 years. The X-ray light curve exhibits a flaring period, followed by a gradual rise and decline. Throughout these events, the X-ray hardness ratio and spectrum do not change significantly. The radio flux is constant, as far as can be determined from its sparse sampling, until the end of the X-ray flare, then decreases by a factor of two by the midpoint of the gradual X-ray rise before returning to baseline at the end of the X-ray decline. We interpret this behavior in light of a similar event recently reported in NGC 2992, in which there is a temporary obscuration of the radio source by a blob of plasma ejected by a magnetic reconnection in the accretion disk. The energetics of the X-ray flare are consistent with those expected from magnetic disk activity. As in NGC 2992, the X-ray spectrum does not evolve during the obscuration event. We also discuss the possibility that the observed phenomena are due to normal AGN coronal flaring and variability, which is plausible but unlikely given the lack of spectral variation.",

      "summary": "A dense neutrino plasma can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by neutrino--neutrino refraction. Recently, a new class of exact nonlinear inhomogeneous solutions was discovered: single-wave (SW) solutions of the fast flavor system. The key property is that the flavor occupation numbers remain homogeneous, whereas the field of flavor coherence varies spatially with a single wave vector. The equations of motion for this structure resemble those of a collection of classical spins, in analogy with the homogeneous slow and fast flavor cases. In contrast, the SW system is not integrable (it does not possess Gaudin invariants) so that, while two-beam pendulum solutions are inevitable, they do not extend to a multi-angle system. We develop a taxonomy of all known nonlinear collective flavor solutions, explaining the overlap between categories and their differences.",

We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on simulated EMRI catalogues to assess how well LISA could constrain the astrophysical population using parametrised population models. We test our inference framework on a variety of populations, including heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures of parametrised subpopulations, and scenarios in which the assumed model is deliberately misspecified. Our results show that population parameters governing distributions with sharp features can be tightly constrained. Mixed populations can be disentangled with as few as $\\sim20$ detections, and even with model misspecification, the inference retains sensitivity to key population features.

The sample is composed of galaxies from the ROGUE I/II catalogue belonging to the SDSS MGS and is divided into optically inactive radio galaxies (OPIRGs), optically active ones (OPARGs) and radio Seyferts. We use optical, mid-infrared and radio data to calculate the AGN bolometric luminosities, accretion rate ($\u03bb$), black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and $\\mathcal{R}$. Results. Contrary to some previous studies based on restricted samples, using our complete sample of objects with redshifts $z < 0.4$, we find no evidence of bimodality in $\\mathcal{R}$. The highest $\\mathcal{R}$ values are associated with extended radio structures. $\\mathcal{R}$ is anti-correlated with $\u03bb$, and spans about 2 dex at fixed $\u03bb$. Radio Seyferts, OPARGs and OPIRGs form a sequence of increasing $M_{BH}$ with substantial overlap. Radio Seyferts show no $\\mathcal{R}$-$M_{BH}$ correlation, whereas OPARGs and OPIRGs show a weak positive trend. From theoretical considerations, the observed two-dex spread in radio luminosity and $\\mathcal{R}$ can be reproduced by a four-fold variation in the dimensionless magnetic flux $\\varphi$ assuming realistic black-hole spins. Conclusions. The smooth distribution of radio loudness supports a common evolutionary path for all radio sources, with black-hole spin and magnetic field varying continuously. The radio loudness depends on black-hole mass and accretion rate, while moderate variations in $\\varphi$ may account for the observed scatter in this relation.",

We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.",

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.",

Applying the Bayesian block algorithm to the 3-day binned $\u03b3$-ray lightcurve, we identify pronounced variability, including four major outbursts marked by significant flux enhancements. The highest flux recorded was $(1.1 \\pm 0.2)\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{ph}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ on 57868.5 MJD. Each outburst comprises multiple components, and lightcurve profile analysis indicates predominantly symmetric temporal structures. The shortest variability timescale of 4.5 hours constrains the emission region to be located within 0.03 pc of the central engine, likely near the broad-line region (BLR). Additionally, two highest-energy photons were detected with energies of 46.4 GeV (on 57739.6 MJD) and 42.5 GeV (on 59161.9 MJD), observed outside the peak flaring activity. The fractional variability shows an overall increasing trend from UV/optical to $\u03b3$-ray bands, with a noticeable dip in the X-ray range, consistent with the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). The flux distributions during flares exhibit log-normal or double log-normal behavior, suggesting multiplicative variability processes and evolving emission zones. Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the $\u03b3$-ray and X-ray bands, with X-rays lagging by 42.5 days. Broadband SED modeling across different flux states supports a one-zone leptonic scenario, with $\u03b3$-ray emission produced via external Compton scattering of IR and BLR photons. High-flux states show harder electron spectra, elevated break energies, and reduced magnetic fields-features consistent with efficient particle acceleration and Compton dominance.",

We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs. Finally, we reanalyse the GW190814 event and four O4a events finding no evidence for LOSA, with the previously claimed LOSA in GW190814 disappearing when a sufficiently long data segment is used.",

However, its value is often determined by considering an asymptotic constant value that works for all redshift, or else following a chosen parameterisation. Here we formulate the growth index as function of three quantities that could be directly related to observables in redshift bins, $f\u03c3_8(z_i)$, $f(z_i)$ and $H(z_i)$. We determine its value and its derivative at observed nodal center of redshift bins and use the shape function method, after showing insightful connection with its underlying governing virtual-work conservation principle, to construct a redshift dependence of the $\u03b3$ without assuming a specific parameterization. We then use the resulting shape function to test if we can disentangle between different scenarios where there are discrepancies between its three constituent measured components. We also tested whether it can be used to rule out models of modified gravity, or extended parametric models of the growth index that capture more general behaviors with an additional parameter as function of the scale factor or dark energy. Adopting forecasted measurements from next generation surveys on the three quantities used to construct $\u03b3$, we find that reported discrepancies between them could be detected with our method, but at the bins where the errors and lost of precision from our addition of degrees of freedom is small with respect to the deviation of $\u03b3$. The same could be concluded for first order extensions to $\u03b3$ or common modified gravity models, and to a lesser degree for dynamical dark energy models after supposing the latest DESI values. We conclude that this method is a strong tool to investigate cosmology in a model-independent way especially with forthcoming data delivered by further stage-IV surveys with more stringent uncertainties.(Abridged)",

In this work, we explore this alternate strategy to probe sub-MeV electrophilic dark matter boosted by cosmic rays with the latest data of LZ 2025 (WS2024 run) and improve the constraint on the MeV scale dark matter by almost $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(1)$ compared to the previous XENONnT limit for energy-independent cross-section. Using realistic energy-dependent cross-sections, we also analyse such a scenario, where the associated mediator mass plays a crucial role in governing the event rate and hence the expected limits too. With energy-dependent cross-sections, our obtained limits also remain stronger than the existing constraints from current direct detection experiments. Even compared to the limits from the neutrino detectors with a larger target size, LZ 2025 can put stringent constraints in certain parameter space of the mediator, excluding the previously unexplored regions.",

However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements.",

Cosmography is useful for interpreting data in cosmology without imposing assumptions about the field equations of gravity or the matter content in the Universe. Some cosmography methods, denoted covariant cosmography, go even further and stay agnostic to the underlying space-time metric. Due to their high level of generality, covariant cosmography methods can incorporate the anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the observer's vicinity, and may in turn inform about the associated curvature of the relevant structures in our cosmic neighbourhood. Thus, covariant cosmography is a powerful model-independent tool for analysing cosmological data while also enabling the mapping of our local cosmic neighbourhood. In order to be able to explore the covariant cosmography framework to its fullest, it must be tested in tractable models and simulations. In this paper we derive the cosmography of luminosity distance to fourth order in redshift and investigate it in the special case of axially symmetric Szekeres models. We compare the numerical results for the distance-redshift relations of synthetic observers placed within the Szekeres structures with the predictions from the cosmography, and comment on the found level of approximation of the cosmography in relation to other results in the litterature.",

      "summary": "Understanding the Universe's origins and evolution remains one of the most fundamental challenges in modern cosmology. This white paper explores three key science priorities in this field: unravelling the physics of cosmic inflation, investigating the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and precisely measuring the sum of the neutrino masses. Achieving these goals requires a dedicated survey to map the large-scale structure at high redshift in unprecedented detail. We describe how this can be achieved through a mission concept called SIRMOS, providing a high-throughput, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability to obtain accurate redshifts for over 100 million galaxies over a wide sky area. Such a survey would leverage the deepest existing wide-area photometric catalogues for targeting, with spectra offering continuous 1.25-2.5~$\u03bc$m wavelength coverage at moderate resolution, allowing precise redshift measurements in the $1<z<4$ range with minimal bias. We outline the scientific opportunities this presents. Recent years have seen significant advances in instrumentation, including digital micromirror devices, complex telescope mirrors, large detector arrays, and data processing pipelines. While these technologies have been demonstrated in terrestrial applications, such a survey is a unique opportunity to apply these proven capabilities in space to address fundamental questions in cosmology. Participation in such a mission will simultaneously deliver a compelling science case, help align UK Space Agency and STFC strategies, demonstrate the UK's growing capability in end-to-end space missions, and strengthen the national space economy through high-value industrial participation.",

For completeness, we also perform Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling algorithms, and compare the results. We note that resampling techniques can help highlight the limitations of the data. For instance, we see that the Jackknife method estimates a strong positive correlation between $h$ and $M$ and higher standard deviations for both. This may have significant implications for the Hubble tension. We conclude with a discussion of our results.",

Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.",

By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $\u039b$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\\pm 0.37~\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $\u03a9_m=0.2973\\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\u03c3_8 = 0.815\\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\\equiv\u03c3_8\\sqrt{\u03a9_m/0.3}=0.811\\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\\%$, $1.7\\%$, and $2\\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6\u03c3$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8\u03c3$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_\u03bd<0.057$ eV in $\u039b$CDM and $M_\u03bd<0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date. Our results suggest that the preference for the normal ordering of neutrino mass states holds regardless of the cosmological background model, and is robust in light of tensions between cosmological datasets.",

In many   such models, the contracting phase is dominated by a single matter component,   typically pressureless dust, which leads to an almost scale-invariant spectrum of   scalar cosmological perturbations with a slight blue tilt, so that generating the   observed red-tilted spectrum within this framework was challenging. In this work, we   consider a more realistic scenario in which the contracting phase includes both   matter and radiation, as required on physical grounds. We show that the presence of   radiation can naturally induce a red tilt in the spectrum of curvature perturbations   seeded by quantum vacuum fluctuations in the remote past of the contraction. Since   the perturbations of the two fluids are coupled via gravity, vacuum initial   conditions must be carefully defined. We demonstrate that, without fine-tuning, the   resulting entropy perturbations are subdominant with respect to curvature   perturbations. This suggests that a minimal two-component bounce model, involving   only ordinary matter and radiation, can connect to the standard expanding cosmology   with observationally viable initial conditions.",

At low redshift, we confront the model with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic-chronometer data, which respectively probe distances, the late-time standard ruler, and the Hubble rate. Independent analyses highlight the complementary roles of each dataset, while a joint SNe Ia + BAO + CC fit breaks degeneracies and yields the tightest combined bounds. As an illustration, we examine two representative torsion-modified gravity scenarios: BBN strongly limits large departures from standard cosmology, whereas late-time probes remain compatible with a near-\u039bCDM background. This unified approach demonstrates the power of linking early-Universe nuclear physics with precision cosmological observables in assessing torsional extensions of gravity.",

However, their large spatial extent and intrinsically underdense environments make their identification highly sensitive to shot noise, redshift-space distortions (RSD), and observational systematics, particularly for topological and density-based void definitions. We introduce the Back-In-Time Void Finder (BitVF), a novel dynamical and physically motivated algorithm that identifies cosmic voids as regions of negative divergence of the Lagrangian displacement field reconstructed from the present-day tracer distribution. The reconstruction relies on an optimized discrete optimal transport algorithm that recovers the backward-in-time dynamics of tracers, naturally accounting for tracer bias without relying on cosmological assumptions. We validate BitVF against the widely used topological void finder REVOLVER using high-resolution N-body simulations, showing that it produces void catalogs with smoother and more physically motivated density profiles, as well as abundances that are more stable under tracer subsampling and shot noise. We further apply it to realistic DESI-like mock light-cone galaxy catalogs, demonstrating that it intrinsically mitigates redshift-space systematic effects, preserving real-space void size functions more faithfully than topological methods. Modeling RSD, the reconstruction can be combined with a fiducial cosmology and an assumed tracer bias within a bias-corrected Kaiser framework, yielding reconstructed-space void catalogs consistent with real-space statistics across redshift. Its performance is characterized as a function of the main internal parameters, showing an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability to stage IV galaxy surveys. BitVF will be publicly released within the CosmoBolognaLib.",

      "summary": "Recent cosmological data favour phantom-crossing dark energy, motivating models with non-minimal couplings that induce a fifth force on structure formation. Reconciling these models with local tests often requires strong screening, leading to environment-dependent clustering. We investigate such effects via a late-time structure-induced phase transition driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose, we introduce norns, a fully relativistic cosmological particle-mesh code that self-consistently evolves a complex scalar field - a generalisation of the symmetron producing global U(1) strings rather than domain walls. Using simulations, we compare string and wall-forming models, quantifying impacts on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and defect dynamics. Strong environment-dependent effects can generate significant departures from LCDM in underdense regions while keeping the overall power spectrum changes modest (~ 4-15% at k~0.3-0.5 h Mpc^-1, sub-percent for z > 0.2). We find that an attractive fifth force can locally suppress structure growth in voids while enhancing it in surrounding overdense regions by driving outflows from the voids. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the matter density probability density function and in marked halo power spectra, which are likely detectable in low-redshift data.",

We use the MagLim++ lens sample, containing $\\sim 9$ million galaxies divided into six redshift bins, and the Metadetection source catalog, including $\\sim 140$ million galaxies divided into four redshift bins. The mean tangential shear signal achieves a total signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of $173$, corresponding to a $17\\%$ improvement over DES Y3. After applying the scale cuts used in the cosmological analysis, with $R_{\\min}=6\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}/h$ ($4\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) for the linear (nonlinear) galaxy-bias model, the S/N is reduced to $75$ (90). A comprehensive suite of validation tests demonstrates that the measurement is robust against observational and astrophysical systematics at the statistical precision required for the DES Y6 analysis. Although not used in the main cosmological analysis, we extract high--signal-to-noise geometric shear-ratio measurements from the galaxy--galaxy lensing signal on small angular scales. These measurements provide an internal consistency check on the photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration used in the $3\\times2$pt analysis.",

      "summary": "We investigate a dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) through a kinetically mixed dark photon $U$ associated with a new $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing $\\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $\u03c7$ via a dark gauge coupling $g_\u03c7$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U\\!\\to e^+e^-$). In PHSD, dark photons are produced in high-energy collisions through Dalitz decays of light mesons ($\u03c0^0,\u03b7,\u03b7',\u03c9$), Delta-resonances ($\u0394\\!\\to N U$), direct vector meson decays ($\u03c1,\u03c9,\u03c6\\!\\to U$), kaon decays, and $q\\bar q\\!\\to U$ annihilation. Building on previous PHSD benchmarks against dilepton data, we extract upper limits on $\\varepsilon^2(m_U,m_\u03c7,\u03b1_\u03c7)$ in both the visible regime ($m_U<2m_\u03c7$), where $U\\!\\to e^+e^-$ dominates, and the invisible regime ($m_U>2m_\u03c7$), where $U\\!\\to\u03c7\\bar\u03c7$ is kinematically open. Cosmological and astrophysical constraints are incorporated in two complementary ways. First, we compute the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section $\u03c3/m_\u03c7$ for Yukawa-mediated SIDM and confront it with bounds from dwarf galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Second, we determine thermal relic target curves by computing the relic abundance and requiring $\u03a9_{\\rm DM}h^2\\simeq 0.12$, consistent with \\textit{Planck} measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Combining PHSD limits on $\\varepsilon^2$ with relic density and self-interaction requirements, we exclude regions of the $(m_\u03c7,m_U)$ plane for each DM realization (Dirac, Majorana, or complex scalar) and identify benchmark scenarios in which heavy-ion, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints are simultaneously satisfied.",

      "summary": "We present a measurement of the angular Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale from the completed Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset excluding the area of overlap with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We follow the same methodology and validation process as in the DES Y6 BAO analysis. We interpret the impact of this measurement in the context of the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM over $\u039b$CDM when combined with DES Y5 Type Ia supernovae (SN), Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and DESI BAO. Based on our previous work, using the full Y6 DES BAO sample, in combination with SN, CMB and DESI DR1 BAO, added 0.3$\u03c3$ in this preference (from 3.7$\u03c3$ to 4.0$\u03c3$), but this ignored possible correlations between datasets. Using our new DESI-independent DES BAO likelihood instead, we find a smaller increase in the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM, from 3.7$\u03c3$ to 3.8$\u03c3$ when using DESI DR1 BAO, and from 4.0$\u03c3$ to 4.1$\u03c3$ when updating to the more recent DESI DR2 BAO. These significances reduce to 3.1$\u03c3$ when using the new calibrated DES SN-Dovekie. Alongside this work, we publicly release BAOfit_wtheta, the BAO fitting code for the angular correlation function used in the DES Y6 BAO analysis.",

      "summary": "The recent detection of a common-spectrum stochastic signal by multiple pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has provided tentative evidence for a nanohertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). This signal can be widely interpreted as originating from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Current PTA analyses primarily constrain the SGWB power spectrum and its auto-angular power spectrum. However, the supermassive black holes will produce an underlying correlation with the large-scale structure of the Universe, which can help in understanding the formation and evolution of the binaries. In this work, we develop a new analysis pipeline PyGxGW-PTA for studying the cross-correlation of nHz GW signal with galaxy surveys ($C^{\\rm g\\, GW}_\\ell$) and obtain the first constraint on the SGWB and galaxy distribution cross-correlation using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset in combination with the DESI galaxy catalog. We find no statistically significant correlation between the SGWB and the large-scale distribution of DESI galaxies and using an optimal estimator we put an upper bound on $C^{\\rm g\\, GW}_{\\ell=8} < 0.0083$ at $95\\%$ C.I. This yields the first observational upper limit on the spatial correlation between the nHz SGWB and the large-scale structure of the Universe, establishing the observational groundwork for future multi-tracer analyses that will combine PTA data with next-generation galaxy surveys to unveil the SMBHB-galaxy correlation.",

In this work, we design and validate the analysis pipeline for the cosmic shear, galaxy clustering plus galaxy$-$galaxy lensing ($2 \\times 2$pt), and the joint analysis in the $3 \\times 2$pt. Our framework accounts for key theoretical uncertainties, such as baryonic feedback and galaxy bias, incorporating both linear and non-linear models. We apply scale cuts in regimes where theoretical modeling becomes unreliable. The robustness of the pipeline is validated using mock data and simulations, confirming unbiased cosmological constraints and highlighting the importance of posterior projection effects in the validation process. As a result, we deliver robust and validated analysis pipelines for cosmic shear, $2 \\times 2$pt, and $3 \\times 2$pt in $\u039b$CDM and $w$CDM scenarios, including a well-defined set of scales suitable for real data analysis, a robust prescription for theoretical systematics, and the theoretical covariance of the signal.

We apply classical molecular dynamics using the improved Kelbg potential for carbon with various forms of the Pauli potential to compute internal energies and pressures for hot, dense plasma conditions. Our results are compared to an equation of state model based on path integral Monte Carlo and density functional theory simulations to examine the extent to which the improved Kelbg potential reproduces the internal energy and pressure of carbon plasmas. The regions of validity for carbon agree generally with those derived previously for hydrogen once pressure ionization effects are incorporated. Based on our carbon results and previously published hydrogen studies, we discuss the general applicability and limitations of these potentials for equation of state studies in warm dense matter and high energy density plasmas.",

Quasi-neutrality along the chaotic magnetic field lines requires a potential that obeys $\\vec{B}\\cdot \\vec{\\nabla} \u03a6= \\vec{B}\\cdot \\vec{\\nabla} p_e$, where $p_e$ is the electron pressure. This potential produces radial transport similar to that of diffusion coefficient $D_{ef}= (\u0394/a_T)T_e/eB$. $\u0394$ is the radial distance over which the potential $\u03a6$ is correlated by the electron motion along the chaotic magnetic field, and $|dT_e/dr| = T_e/a_T$. The chaos-produced electron transport gives an effective viscosity on the electron flow, which can counter balance a non-ambipolar part of the ion radial particle diffusion $f_{na}$. This non-ambipolarity would otherwise require a radial electric field that confines ions and hence impurities. The maximum $f_{na}$ that can be counterbalanced and the required plasma beta to avoid shielding the magnetic perturbations $\\tilde{B}$ are calculated.",

      "summary": "Understanding electron energy dynamics in low-temperature plasmas such as capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs), including energy absorption, conversion, transport, and dissipation, is essential for interpreting discharge physics and process applications. We propose a kinetic-moment framework based on particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulations. The framework reconstructs the first three velocity moments of the Boltzmann equation directly from PIC/MCC data and enables a quantitative, self-consistent description of electron energy dynamics in low-pressure CCPs. To clarify energy conversion among electromagnetic energy, electron fluid kinetic (mechanical) energy, and electron thermal (internal) energy, we further separate the total energy transport equation into kinetic- and thermal-energy equations. We find that, at low pressure, electrons gain directed kinetic energy in the sheath and convert it locally into thermal energy through pressure-strain interaction and collisions. Thermal energy is then transported into the bulk and is dissipated mainly by inelastic electron-neutral collisions. We further decompose pressure-strain interaction into reversible pressure dilatation and irreversible viscous-like dissipation, which correspond to conversion driven by volumetric compression or expansion and by shear deformation, respectively. This decomposition reveals a significant thermalization channel beyond collisions. More broadly, the results show coexistence of localized kinetic-to-thermal conversion near the sheath and nonlocal energy transport from the sheath to the bulk dominated by microscopic heat flux. The heat flux deviates strongly from Fourier's law based on local temperature gradients. This framework provides a clear fluid description with kinetic fidelity and offers a practical tool for analyzing energy evolution in nonequilibrium plasmas.",

      "summary": "Turbulent transport remains one of the principal obstacles to achieving efficient magnetic confinement in fusion devices. Two of the dominant drivers of the turbulence are microscale instabilities fuelled by electron- and ion-temperature gradients (ETG and ITG), whose nonlinear saturation determines the cross-field transport of particles and energy. Despite decades of study, predictive modelling of this turbulence has been limited either to expensive gyrokinetic simulations or to reduced models calibrated by fitting to numerical or experimental data, restricting their utility for reactor design. Here we present a simple asymptotic scaling theory that unifies ETG- and ITG-driven turbulence within a common framework. By balancing the fundamental time scales of linear growth, nonlinear decorrelation, and parallel propagation, the theory isolates the dependence of the heat flux on equilibrium parameters to two key quantities: the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio. We show that these quantities encapsulate the essential physics of saturation, leading to distinct predictions for ETG and ITG transport: a cubic scaling with the temperature gradient in the electron channel, and a linear scaling in the ion channel. Extensive nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm that these theoretical predictions hold irrespective of the magnetic geometry (slab, tokamak, or stellarator), including the first numerical confirmation of the cubic ETG scaling anticipated by earlier theory. By isolating the dependence on just the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio, our framework provides a physics-based foundation for fast, geometry-aware transport models, offering a pathway toward reactor optimisation in both tokamaks and stellarators.",

In this configuration, electrons are first accelerated inside an underdense plasma by a relativistic laser pulse and subsequently interact with the reflected laser field, emitting high-energy photons via nonlinear Compton scattering which decay into electron-positron pairs through the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. Using analytical scalings supported by quasi-3D particle-in-cell simulations including QED effects, we demonstrate that a laser pulse with power as low as 2 PW is sufficient to reach the quantum regime characterized by $\u03c7_e> 1$ . For higher powers, we observe a rapid nonlinear increase in the number of generated positrons, reaching more than 2 nC for a 10 PW laser pulse with energy of approximately 1.1 kJ. A semi-analytical model is employed to estimate the positron yield, showing good agreement with simulation results. We further study the influence of laser depletion and the positioning of the reflecting foil on the efficiency of pair production. The presented scheme provides an experimentally feasible platform for probing strong-field QED effects using currently available multi-petawatt laser systems.",

This concept extends the traditional notion of omnigenity, the theoretical principle upon which most of existing magnetic fusion reactor designs, including tokamaks, are based. While piecewise omnigenity broadens the range of potentially viable stellarator reactor candidates, it is achieved by relaxing the requirement of continuity in the magnetic field strength, which could appear to pose significant challenges for the design of magnetohydrodynamic equilibria. In this work, a stellarator magnetic configuration is presented that satisfies the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium equation and that achieves unprecedented levels of piecewise omnigenity. As a result, it exhibits favorable transport characteristics, including reduced bulk radial (neoclassical and turbulent transport), bootstrap current and fast ion losses. In addition, the configuration displays robust MHD stability across a range of \\b{eta} values and possesses a rotational transform profile compatible with an island divertor. Collectively, these features satisfy the standard set of physics criteria required for a viable reactor candidate which, until now, were believed to be attainable only by certain types of omnigenous stellarators.",

A bifurcation transition occurs when the high-field-side radiation front crosses the separatrix while the outer divertor remains attached, with the $T_e$ cliff manifesting distinctly when the outer target $T_e \\gtrsim 10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ prior to the bifurcation.

Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting. By relying only on measured scattering parameters, this gradient-free approach is robust to experimental drift and noise and does not require complex full-wave models. Significant performance improvements over traditional simulation-based (in-silico) inverse design are demonstrated, with in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x higher isolation between ports than the best in-silico design at the same target frequency. This work also presents guidelines for applying Bayesian optimization to noisy, high-dimensional physical systems.",

Using the STRIPE modeling framework-which integrates SOLPS-ITER, COMSOL, RustBCA, and GITR/GITRm-we simulate carbon erosion, re-deposition, and global impurity transport in two H-mode discharges with varying antenna--plasma gaps and RF powers. COMSOL predicts rectified sheath potentials of 1-5 kV, localized near the bottom of the antenna where magnetic field lines intersect at grazing angles. Erosion is dominated by carbon self-sputtering, with RF-accelerated D+ ions contributing up to 1 % of the total erosion flux. GITRm simulations show that in the small-gap case, only ~ 13 % of eroded carbon is re-deposited locally, with 58 % transported into the core. In contrast, the large-gap case exhibits lower total erosion, along with reduced core penetration (~ 35 %) and weaker re-deposition (~ 4 %), consistent with lower collisionality and limited plasma contact. The simulation trends are consistent with experimental observations, which have not shown elevated core impurity levels during helicon operation in the present graphite-wall configuration. However, under certain plasma conditions and magnetic configurations, the helicon antenna may still act as a finite source of net erosion and core-directed impurity transport, potentially influencing the overall core impurity balance. These findings emphasize the need for sheath-aware antenna designs and predictive impurity transport modeling to support future high-power RF systems with high-Z first wall materials in fusion devices.",

Despite their attractive properties, QP fields are not amenable to the near-axis expansion, a major theoretical tool for understanding toroidal fields. In this paper, we provide a novel framework for defining and understanding QP flux surfaces. This framework relies on a simplification that transforms the task of finding a quasi-poloidal flux surface from a 3D problem to a 2D problem. This simplification also applies to asymmetric magnetic mirrors with desirable properties. We sketch how this 2D problem can form the basis of an efficient optimisation problem for finding QP flux surfaces. We leverage this 2D problem for theoretical understanding: for instance, we identify one class of QP flux surfaces that are naturally flat mirrors (Velasco et al. 2023). The reduced model is validated against numerically optimised QP equilibria. We further utilise the reduced model to explain the prevalence of cusps, high mirror ratios, and narrow pinch points in these numerical equilibria.",

      "summary": "We present an analytical and numerical study of how Doppler-induced spectral broadening in laser-heated plasmas degrades the coherence of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) signals, and show that the resulting loss of temporal coherence reduces the SAXS intensity. Applying this formalism to two benchmark geometries - single density steps (wires) and periodic gratings -- we obtain analytic estimates. For gratings, finite coherence simultaneously lowers Bragg-peak heights and broadens their widths, whereas for isolated steps only the overall scaling with q affected. We map the parameter space relevant to current SASE and self-seeded XFELs, revealing that Doppler effects remain managable for the trieval of geometry parameters (less than few 10 % error) for SASE bandwidths but become the dominant error source in seeded configurations or above-keV temperatures. Practical consequences for density-gradient retrieval and interface-sharpness measurements are quantified. The results supply clear criteria for when Doppler broadening must be included in SAXS data analysis and offer a route to infer electron temperature directly from coherence-loss signatures.",

      "summary": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the velocity-moment-based quasi-linear (QL) theory of waves and instabilities in plasmas with nonequilibrium velocity distributions (VDs) of the Kappa (or $\u03ba$) type. However, the temporal variation of the parameter $\u03ba$, which quantifies the presence of suprathermal particles, is not fully captured by such a QL analysis, and typically $\u03ba$ remains constant during plasma dynamics. We propose a new QL modeling that goes beyond the limits of a previous approach, realistically assuming that the quasithermal core cannot evolve independently of energetic suprathermals. The case study is done on the electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability generated by anisotropic bi-Kappa electrons with $A=T_\\perp/T_\\parallel > 1$ ($\\parallel, \\perp$ denoting directions with respect to the background magnetic field). The parameter $\u03ba$ self-consistently varies through the QL equation of kurtosis (fourth-order moment) coupled with temporal variations of the temperature components, relaxing the constraint on the independence of the low-energy (core) electrons and suprathermal high-energy tails of VDs. The results refine and extend previous approaches. A clear distinction is made between regimes that lead to a decrease or an increase in the $\u03ba$ parameter with saturation of the instability. What predominates is a decrease in $\u03ba$, i.e., an excess of suprathermalization, which energizes suprathermal electrons due to self-generated wave fluctuations. Additionally, we found that VDs can evolve toward a quasi-Maxwellian shape (as $\u03ba$ increases) primarily in regimes with low beta and initial kappa values greater than five. Instability-driven relaxation only partially resolves temperature anisotropy in bi-Kappa electron VDs, as wave fluctuations generally act to further energize suprathermal electrons.",

We also introduce a more general integro-differentiable operator formulation to probe relevant terms in the collision operator. To validate the proposed methodology we use data generated by self-consistent electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell simulations. We show that both approaches recover operators that can accurately reproduce the plasma phase space dynamics while being more accurate than estimates based on particle track statistics. These results further demonstrate the potential of using differentiable simulators to infer collision operators for scenarios where no closed form solution exists or deviations from existing theory are expected.",

The absolute atom densities and translational temperatures were determined over a range of pressures and RF power . At pressures of 267 Pa and above, the O atom mole fraction increases with RF power and decreases with pressure, reaching a maximum of 15 percent. However, at 133 and 67 Pa it passes through a distinct maximum with power before decreasing significantly. The atom recombination processes are probed by time resolved measurements in the afterglow of pulse modulated plasmas. At 133 and 67 Pa the atom loss is dominated by surface recombination, and we see clear evidence that this rate is increased by energetic ion bombardment, in agreement with a study from Bill Graham group. This effect partially explains the observed decrease in dissociation at high RF power. The time-resolved results also allow the O negative ion density to be determined and indicate the creation of ozone in the afterglow. At 133 Pa, the trends with RF power of the O2 dissociation, O negative ion density and gas temperature suggest a transition at high power to a plasma mode with fewer high energy electrons. At higher pressures gas phase recombination mechanisms become dominant, however gas convection driven by gas cooling in the afterglow makes it complex to analyse the time-resolved data.",

We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.",

We focus on spectral analysis and plasma instability analysis, using ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity and polarization properties with respect to the background magnetic field $B_0$. In the first interval, the ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity shows a left-handed circularly polarized signature. In the second interval, the left-handed signature persists and an additional high-frequency right-handed population appears. The propagation is approximately parallel to $B_0$. The left-handed fluctuations are compatible with Alfv\u00e9n ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves, while the right-handed fluctuations are consistent with fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves. The ICME plasma accesses resonance conditions that support multiple ion-scale wave modes. Evolving anisotropies in the plasma and the approach to marginal stability allow the coexistence of AIC-like and fast-magnetosonic/whistler-like fluctuations, with enhanced electron heating favoring the growth of the FM/W contribution and strengthening the density--magnetic-field magnitude correlation.",

Error field correction coils are designed to couple to the plasma-amplified kink that dominates the drive of core resonances. The maximum allowable error field is projected to SPARC using an empirical scaling that is consistent with linear and nonlinear MHD modeling expectations.

Using a hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic model-based Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code with fully kinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons, we simulate Harris-type current sheets and velocity shear layers with strong cross-field density gradients. Our central hypothesis is that steep density gradients drive LHDI, which can grow faster than KHI and initiate an inverse cascade from kinetic to fluid scales, potentially suppressing KHI. Our simulations confirm that, in thin current sheets, LHDI develops rapidly at the sheet edges and nonlinearly merges into larger-scale magnetic islands before KHI can evolve. These LHDI-driven structures distort the velocity shear and suppress classical KH vortices. In contrast, for thicker current sheets or weaker density gradients, KHI dominates and produces the expected rolled-up vortices and associated plasmoids. These findings demonstrate that LHDI-induced turbulence can act as both a seed and a regulator of plasmoid-generating instabilities, mediating cross-scale energy transfer. This mechanism is relevant to thin boundary layers in space plasmas, such as the solar wind magnetosphere interface, and suggests that microturbulence can govern large-scale magnetic topology during collisionless reconnection.",

      "summary": "The field of plasma physics heavily relies on simulations to model various phenomena, such as instabilities, turbulence, and nonlinear behaviors that would otherwise be difficult to study from a purely theoretical approach. Simulations are fundamental in accurately setting up experiments, which can be extremely costly and complex. As high-fidelity tools, gyrokinetic simulations play a crucial role in discovering new physics, interpreting experimental results, and improving the design of next-generation devices. However, their high computational costs necessitate the use of acceleration platforms to reduce execution time. This work revolves around the TRIangular MEsh based Gyrokinetic (TRIMEG) code, which performs high-accuracy particle-in-cell plasma simulations in tokamak geometries, leveraging a novel finite element approach. The rise of graphical processing units (GPUs) constitutes an occasion to satisfy such computational needs, by offloading the most expensive portion of the code to the accelerators. The chosen approach features GPU offloading with the OpenMP API, which grants portability of the code to different architectures, namely AMD and NVIDIA. The particle pushing as well as the grid-to-particle operations have been ported to GPU platforms. Compiler limitations had to be overcome, and portions of the code were restructured to be suitable for GPU acceleration. Kernel performance was evaluated by carrying out GPU grid size exploration, as well as scalability studies. In addition, the efficiency of hybrid MPI-OpenMP offloading parallelization was assessed.

We show that these functions are solutions of an inhomogeneous Bessel ODE, with specified initial conditions and a distinct right-hand-side term fulfilling the Nielsen's requirement. Beside deriving recurrence relations and an alternative representation involving incomplete Anger-Weber functions, we show that these functions admit a simple series expansion in terms of Bessel functions of integer order, obtained by resorting to the Jacobi-Anger formula. In plasma applications this eventually leads to expressions involving infinite sums of products of Bessel functions, not particularly apt to numerical evaluation ought to their slow convergence rate when the particle's gyro-radius is larger than the wavelength. By exploiting the previously determined recurrence properties of the new class of functions we present a particularly simple derivation of the linear susceptibility tensor that enables to avoid this inconvenience.",

      "summary": "Circular cross-section plasma is the most basic form of tokamak plasma and the fundamental configuration for magnetic confinement fusion experiments. Based on the HL-2A limiter discharge experiments, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium and MHD instability of circular cross-section tokamak plasmas are investigated in this work. The results show that when q_0=0.95, the internal kink mode of m/n=1/1 is always unstable. The increase in plasma \\b{eta} (the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) can lead to the appearance of external kink modes. The combination of axial safety factor q_0 and edge safety factor q_a determines the equilibrium configuration of the plasma and also affects the MHD stability of the equilibrium, but its growth rate is also related to the size of \\b{eta}. Under the condition of q_a>2 and q_0 slightly greater than 1, the internal kink mode and surface kink mode can be easily stabilized. However the plasma becomes unstable again and the instability intensity increases as q_0 continues to increase when q_0 exceeds 1. As the poloidal beta (\\b{eta}_p) increases, the MHD instability develops, the equilibrium configuration of MHD elongates laterally, and the Shafranov displacement increases, which in turn has the effect on suppressing instability. Calculations have shown that the maximum \\b{eta} value imposed by the ideal MHD mode in a plasma with free boundary in tokamak experiments is proportional to the normalized current I_N (I_N=I_p (MA)/a(m)B_0 (T)), and the achievable maximum beta \\b{eta}(max) is calibrated to be 2.01I_N,i.e. \\b{eta}(max)~2.01I_N. The operational \\b{eta} limit of HL-2A circular cross-section plasma is approximately \\b{eta}_N^c~2.0. Too high a value of q_0 is not conducive to MHD stability and leads the \\b{eta} limit value to decrease. When q_0=1.3, we obtain a maximum value of \\b{eta}_N of approximately 1.8.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate that such time interfaces can be utilized to generate large, highly localized quasistatic magnetic fields within the metasurfaces. The resulting nanoscale magnetization, supported by the residual circulating currents, persists after the departure of the time-scattered MGWs. We further demonstrate that the initial electromagnetic energy of the injected MGWs is partitioned between the time-reflected/refracted MGWs, residual motion of the free carriers, and a quasistatic magnetic field.",

We test our method using data from two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations of spatially uniform thermal plasmas, and learn the collision operator that captures the self-consistent electromagnetic interaction between finite-size charged particles over a wide variety of simulation parameters. We demonstrate that the learned operators are more accurate than alternative estimates based on particle tracks, while making no prior assumptions about the relevant time-scales of the processes and significantly reducing memory requirements. We find that the retrieved operators, obtained in the non-relativistic regime, are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions derived for electrostatic scenarios.

The framework is further extended to relativistic regime where an additional source of canonical vorticity, termed as kineclinicity effect, is identified. The theoretical predictions are systematically validated using particle-in-cell simulations, highlighting their implications for laboratory and astrophysical plasma environments.",

These simulations are enabled by the 10-moment collisionless fluid solver of Gkeyll, which evolves the full pressure tensor for all species. The electron heat-flux closure regulates pressure isotropization and effectively sets the magnetic Reynolds number. We investigate how the strength of of the closure influences the transition between a regime reminiscent of previous kinetic pair-plasma simulations and a more MHD-like dynamo regime.",

We perform 1X-2V Boltzmann-Poisson simulations of an axial cut at the pinch radius of a Z-pinch plasma between two biased electrodes with a magnetic field parallel to the wall. The collision frequencies are artificially increased to enhance thermalization of the plasma in the smaller simulation domain versus the actual experiment size; this increases the perpendicular mobility and partially de-magnetizes the ions resulting in non-monotonic sheath profiles with the potential increasing away from the wall to a peak before decaying. A classical sheath forms within an electron gyroradius from the wall not due to the natural thermal motion of the electrons, but due to the magnetized electrons gyrating into the wall; therefore, the sheath structure does not significantly change with bias potential or between electrodes. With increasing bias potential, a current is induced perpendicular to the wall due to changes in ion flow, differing from unmagnetized cases where current is induced by changes in electron flow. The magnetic field acts as a high resistivity with the perpendicular current density being three orders of magnitude lower than unmagnetized theoretical predictions. There is, however, significant flow parallel to the wall from the force balance between the pressure tensor and Lorentz force. These parallel flows induce a parallel current density three orders of magnitude larger than the perpendicular current density.",

Perfectly collimated drivers produce wakes propagating at the speed of light, allowing electron phase-locking (limited by driver depletion). Non-collimated drivers induce subluminal phase velocities, limiting acceleration via dephasing.

      "summary": "We use the high-resolution Swarm faceplate plasma density data at 16 Hz to develop a set of parameters that can characterize multi-scale ionospheric structures and irregularities along the Swarm orbit. We present the methods for calculating density gradients over different window sizes, rate of change of density index, power spectral density and the spectral slope at both low and high latitudes. The faceplate plasma data are not continuously available through the years. However, about 8 years of data from Swarm A are processed from late 2014 to the end of 2025. Some statistical results from Swarm A are presented. The variations of plasma structures and irregularities are dependent on solar activity, season, local time and geomagnetic activities, and the variations show different patterns between low and high latitudes. For example, the high-latitude ionosphere is characterized by persistent ionospheric structures and irregularities poleward of 60 magnetic latitude, while the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities are only dominant during 19-01 local time near the magnetic equator. The occurrence of steep spectral slope at high latitudes shows clear seasonal variations, i.e., it maximizes during local summer and minimizes during local winter in both hemispheres. However, the occurrence of steep spectral slope at low latitudes is only sensible when significant plasma structures and irregularities are present. We further calculate the histogram of spectral slopes at low latitudes when the rate of change of density index is enhanced. The histogram resembles a Gaussian distribution with an expected value of 1.97. The processed data are available to the wider community. Given the high resolution, this new data product will be useful for the scientific communities that are interested in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and near-Earth space environment.",

      "summary": "The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\u03b7~\\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the \"frozen-in\" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.",

Using a fully-compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we quantify the subgrid-scale energy transfer and analyze its relationship to streamline structures by means of grandient tensor geometric invariants of the velocity field. Our results highlight how streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence: for nearly-incompressible fluctuations the energy is primarily transferred to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, while is back-transferred towards larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations, on the contrary, do not show a clear topological selection of the energy transfer since the overall direction of the local cascade rate is found to be determined by the sign of $-\\nabla\\cdot u$ (plasma volumetric compression or expansion).",

      "summary": "The knowledge of local spatial gradients (curl, divergence etc.) is crucial to examine the three-dimensional variation of flow fields including velocity and magnetic fields in space plasmas like the solar wind. Here we propose a simple method to calculate the same using the in-situ data of multi-spacecraft systems. Unlike the popular Curlometer method which depends on the vector integration theorems, our integration-free method is based on the construction of a local orthonormal coordinate system and the associated finite difference approximations. The Curlometer is applicable to a four spacecraft system arranged in a tetrahedron and yields a single volume-averaged estimate of the curl. Using our proposed method over 107 intervals of MMS (NASA) data, on the other hand, we successfully calculate the spatial derivatives at the position of each spacecraft of the tetrahedron and a three-spacecraft (non-collinear) subset of the same. The average value of all the curls calculated for a given tetrahedron shows an excellent agreement (correlation coeffcient ~ 0:99) with the curls calculated using Curlometer formula. The quality of the calculated curl (using our method) is found to improve if the spacecraft configuration approaches a regular tetrahedron. The current framework facilitates investigation of turbulent heating rates and the exploration of local flow features like Beltramization, existence of current sheets, etc., in present and future multi-spacecraft mission, including those involving more than four spacecraft.",

      "summary": "A demonstrated failure mode for operational solar flare forecasting is the inability to forecast flares that occur near, or just beyond, the solar limb. To address this shortcoming, we develop a \"4pi\" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a \"visibility\" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far (\"invisible\" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or \"missed\" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources.",

      "summary": "Magnetic switchbacks are fluctuations in the solar wind in which the interplanetary magnetic field sharply deflects away from its background direction so as to create folds in magnetic field lines while remaining of roughly constant magnitude. The magnetic field and velocity fluctuations are extremely well correlated in a way corresponding to Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations propagating away from the Sun. For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation. We identify and collate several open questions and recommendations for future studies.",

      "summary": "Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.",

      "summary": "Full-disk observations from missions such as the SDO and SOHO have enabled comprehensive studies of solar oscillations and dynamics. Interpreting helioseismic and photospheric data is complicated by systematic center-to-limb variations. To explore the physical origin of these variations, we perform local 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations that include effects of solar rotation to generate 24-hour synthetic time series of continuum intensity and Doppler velocity for nine viewing angles spanning from -75 to 75 degrees. The simulations reveal a systematic decrease in oscillation power toward the limbs and a pronounced East-West asymmetry that increases with frequency, primarily due to rotation-induced flows. With increasing angular distance from the disk center, the amplitudes and widths of the surface gravity (f) and resonant pressure (p) modes decrease. In contrast, the amplitudes of the corresponding pseudo-modes with frequencies above the acoustic cut-off frequency increase in the intensity power spectra but are suppressed in the velocity spectra. The local helioseismology ring-diagram analysis of the simulation data further demonstrates anisotropic broadening of the modes and distinct differences in background noise and pseudo-mode structure between the intensity and velocity data. These results indicate that the center-to-limb effects arise from both geometric projection and physical factors such as line-formation height and potential effects of the radial differential rotation. The findings provide a framework for correcting helioseismic observations and demonstrate that realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations are a powerful tool for disentangling geometric and physical biases in solar data.",

The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.",

Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $\u03ba= 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $\u03ba\\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $\u03ba\\to 1.5$ limit.",

Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.",

A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.",

      "summary": "Collisionless fast-magnetosonic shocks are often treated as smooth, planar boundaries, yet observations point to organized corrugation of the shock surface. A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\u03b2$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.",

      "summary": "The Gannon Storm in May 2024 was the largest space weather event experienced in 20 years, generating auroras latitudes as low as 35\u00b0. Such activity can pose significant operational challenges for critical infrastructure operators, particularly those managing electricity transmission networks, satellite constellations, and aviation systems. Substantial progress has been made in understanding space weather and the potential exposure of infrastructure assets to severe events. We have seen few evaluations of the types of current mitigation strategies in use to reduce our shared vulnerability to this activity, motivating this study. Firstly, we fill an important literature gap by undertaking a systematic review of the range of space weather mitigation strategies for these three critical infrastructure sectors. Secondly, we contacted 303 critical infrastructure operators (50 power, 227 satellite, 26 aviation) for participation in an anonymous online survey or interview receiving 55 unique responses (18% response rate). To capture narratives of mitigation actions taken and impacts experienced over the solar maximum, qualitative interviews were then conducted with 33 operators. The results identified 91 potential mitigation actions within the sectors and found that 149 mitigation actions were enacted due to space weather forecasts and experienced impacts. This is one of the first exhaustive studies of space weather mitigation activities, and moves beyond the traditional focus on purely impacts.",

Here, we statistically analyze magnetic field power spectra across 370 magnetotail CSs observed by MESSENGER. About 20% of the events are quasi-laminar, showing single power-law spectra, whereas 80% are turbulent, exhibiting a spectral break separating inertial and kinetic ranges. A dawn-dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial-range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic-range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection-related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail-aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near -1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range. These results demonstrate that Mercury's unique plasma environment fundamentally reshapes the initiation of turbulence and the redistribution of energy in the magnetotail.",

      "summary": "Fast and slow solar wind have distinct properties linked to their solar sources.Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind complicates the usual speed-based classification, especially at intermediate speeds. Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfv\u00e9nic streams: one fast wind, three Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfv\u00e9nicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfv\u00e9nic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfv\u00e9nicity relates to the solar source conditions.",

We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations.",

      "summary": "In solar wind turbulence, the energy transfer/dissipation rate is typically estimated using MHD third-order structure functions calculated using spacecraft observations. However, the inherent anisotropy of solar wind turbulence leads to significant variations in structure functions along different observational directions, thereby affecting the accuracy of energy-dissipation rate estimation. An unresolved issue is how to optimise the selection of observation angles under limited directional sampling to improve estimation precision. We conduct a series of MHD turbulence simulations with different mean magnetic field strengths, $ B_0 $. Our analysis of the third-order structure functions reveals that the global energy dissipation rate estimated around a polar angle of $ \u03b8= 60^\\circ$ agrees reasonably with the exact one for $ 0 \\le B_0/b_{rms} \\le 5 $, where $b_{rms}$ denotes the root-mean-square magnetic field fluctuation. The speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle can be understood by the Mean Value Theorem of Integrals, since the spherical integral of the polar-angle component ($\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$) of the divergence of Yaglom flux is zero, and $\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$ changes sign around 60$^\\circ$. Existing theory on the energy flux vector as a function of the polar angle is assessed, and supports the speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle. The angular dependence of the third-order structure functions is further assessed with virtual spacecraft data analysis. The present results can be applied to measure the turbulent dissipation rates of energy in the solar wind, which are of potential importance to other areas in which turbulence takes place, such as laboratory plasmas and astrophysics.",

To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and \u03b8_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.",

Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.",

There exists some ambiguity whether magnetodisc scattering or high-latitude Alfvenic acceleration best describes the observed properties of these injection signatures, and also to what extent arcs in the outer emission are related to injections. Many injection signatures are the result of the evolution of dawn storms; there is, however, limited evidence that non-dawn-storm injection signatures are sometimes present in the aurora. We use automatic detection of these discrete features, alongside data from Juno-UVS and in-situ measurements by other Juno instruments, to show that scattering likely accounts for most of the electron precipitation associated with injection signatures. Additionally, there is evidence that injection signatures can be classified into two types: dawn-storm and non-dawn-storm. Arc-like features in the outer emission show very similar properties to traditional blob-like injection signatures and may consist of sequences of injection signatures that have broadened into an arc via energy-dependent electron drift.",

      "summary": "A common occurrence in weakly collisional space plasmas is the unequal electron-ion temperatures. The pressure-strain interaction provides a mechanism-agnostic pathway for increasing plasma internal energy through spatiotemporally local isotropic compression and volume preserving deformation, yet its behavior under thermal disequilibrium is largely unexplored. We investigate this using five fully kinetic two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of undriven decaying turbulence by varying the initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio. By analyzing the species' internal energy density alongside a decomposition of the pressure-strain term, with a focus on the volume-preserving deformation that contains normal and shear contributions, we quantify how the initial temperature imbalance modifies the channels through which turbulence increases each species' internal energy density. The cumulative pressure-strain interaction tracks the change in internal energy for both electrons and ions, with the total deformation channel of energy conversion dominating. We discover that local changes to electron internal energy density are governed primarily by the shear deformation power density, concentrated in electron-scale current sheets, while the ion shear and normal deformation components cancel, yielding a much smaller net deformation power density that peaks around, rather than within, those electron-scale current structures. We find that the amplitudes and localization of deformation change, but preserve these qualitative trends. Together, these results show how thermal disequilibrium could shape species-dependent turbulent \"heating rate\", measured via pressure-strain interaction and approximated via only its shear deformation part, and provide a framework for interpreting energy evolution and conversion in space plasmas where unequal species temperature is the norm.",

These outputs are then fed into the coupled Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) - ENLIL model and compared to an operational version of WSA-ENLIL (without ADAPT). SWPC selected a set of 38 historical events over the period of five years from 2012--2014 (33 events) and 2017--2019 (5 events). The overall three-year project consisted of multiple simulation validation studies for the entire event set (1292 simulations): (a) benchmark single map (operational version prior to May 2019) (b) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving WSA-ENLIL with 4 different model settings (c) single test simulation of a time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (d) single GONG map driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (e) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL. We report that for all 38 events, within each model version/settings combination, the CME arrival time error decreased by 0.2 to 0.9 hours when using a sequence of time-dependent zero-point corrected magnetograms compared to using single magnetogram input. Overall, for all events, when using the older uncorrected magnetograms, the CME arrival time error increased for all new model versions/settings combination compared to the benchmark. Notably for the 5 events in the period 2017--2019 when more reliable zero-point corrected magnetograms were available, the ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (median arrival realization) CME arrival time error decreased against all benchmarks. In this report we also discuss replicating the operational model, challenges in detecting CME arrival in simulations, and comparing zero-point corrected and uncorrected magnetogram inputs.",

Using the energy spectra measured in two mutually orthogonal top hat analyzers (THA 1 and 2), which are part of the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) subsystem of the Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on board India's Aditya L1 mission, we gain insights into intricate features of ICME ICME interactions during May 2024 solar event. We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.",

Accurate SEP forecasting remains a critical challenge in space weather research due to their complex origins and highly variable propagation. In this work, we built SEPNET, an innovative multi-task neural network that jointly predicts future solar eruptive events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and SEPs, incorporating long short-term memory and transformer architectures that capture contextual dependencies. SEPNet is a machine learning framework for SEP prediction that utilizes an extensive set of predictors, including solar flares, CMEs, and space-weather HMI active region patches (SHARP) magnetic field parameters. SEPNET is rigorously evaluated on the SEPVAL SEP dataset (Whitman, 2025b), which is used to evaluate the performance of the current SEP prediction models. The performance of SEPNet is compared with classical machine learning methods and current state-of-the-art pre-eruptive SEP prediction models. The results show that SEPNET, particularly with SHARP parameters, achieves higher detection rates and skill scores while maintaining suitable for real-time space weather alert operations. Although class imbalance in the data leads to relatively high false alarm rates, SEPNET consistently outperforms reference methods and provides timely SEP forecasts, highlighting the capability of deep multi-task learning for next-generation space weather prediction.

The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms.",

This approach derives universal linear couplings to the trace anomaly while preserving consistent renormalization group evolution. We establish a hierarchical EFT tower connecting the ultraviolet conformal sector to the infrared, encompassing the dilaton-extended SMEFT, low-energy EFT up to dimension-7, and a chiral Lagrangian describing meson and baryon interactions. We perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis across two distinct mass regimes, where dilaton manifests as either conventional particle or wave-like particle. For MeV-scale dilatons behaving as conventional particles, we obtain constraints from LHC production, semi-invisible $B$- and $K$-meson decays, and supernova cooling. For ultralight dilatons acting as dark matter, we project sensitivities for atomic clocks and atom interferometers. This unified EFT framework would pave the way for extended phenomenological studies across the full mass spectrum of the light dilaton.",

This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be cancelled by conservative memory contributions from radiative regions. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.",

      "summary": "Cosmological first-order phase transitions are a well-motivated source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs), but most predictions are made based on the highly idealized model of perfectly spherical vacuum bubbles, neglecting thermal fluctuations. In this work we use $(3+1)$-dimensional lattice simulations of a scalar model with thermal initial conditions to quantify how thermal fluctuations distort bubble profiles and modify the resulting GW spectrum. We find that thermal fluctuations can strongly break spherical symmetry at early times, allowing even an isolated bubble to emit GWs. In multi-bubble simulations, thermal fluctuations systematically reshape the spectrum, suppressing the infrared part while enhancing and broadening the high-$k$ tail. We further provide an analytical estimate for the ultraviolet regime of the GW spectrum, which is in good agreement with our lattice results and suggests that this regime is dominated by thermal fluctuations. These effects could leave observable imprints in future GW searches.",

This new channel is always present when considering the thermally-induced Higgs decay to leptons and relativistic sterile neutrinos, and can become dominant thanks to thermally-generated lepton-doublet flavour oscillations. This mechanism can yield the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe, even if there is no resonant enhancement from quasi-degenerate sterile neutrinos. The required active-to-sterile neutrino mixing differs from the other two low-scale leptogenesis channels and can be probed in fixed-target and long-lived particle experiments, and by displaced vertex searches at high-energy colliders.",

All new fields, which have nonzero charges under the non-invertible symmetry, can be dark matter candidates, since the non-invertible symmetry possesses a remnant ${Z}_2$ symmetry that plays a role in assuring the stability of our dark matter candidate. Even though the non-invertible symmetry is dynamically broken at one-loop level, its violation does not affect our scenario. In this paper, we especially consider the lightest mode of the neutral components in the doublet vector-like fermions as our main dark matter candidate. The dark matter is potentially degenerated to the other two families of neutral fermions, since the mass difference is induced at one-loop level. Thus, we consider our dark matter candidate in rather simpler co-annihilation system among their particles. Considering all the constraints of neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$ and the relic density of dark matter, we perform the numerical analysis and show some allowed regions for these phenomenology. Due to our dark matter nature, the sum of neutrino masses in case of normal hierarchy is larger than that in case of inverted hierarchy, which is opposite situation compared with typical active neutrino models.",

Using the self-analyzing weak decays $\u039b\\to p\u03c0^-$ and $\\bar\u039b \\to \\bar{p}\u03c0^+$, we derive the joint angular distributions within QFT. Our key findings are: For scalar production $h \\to \u039b\\bar\u039b$, no LHVT respecting locality and angular-momentum conservation can reproduce the QFT distribution. For pseudoscalar production $a \\to \u039b\\bar\u039b$, a CPT-symmetric LHVT is excluded by positivity constraints given the measured analyzing powers; however, if CPT symmetry is relaxed, an explicit LHVT construction, with uniform hidden-variable measure and response functions satisfying $b_1 c_1 = 3\u03b1_\u039b\u03b1_{\\bar\u039b}$, can match the QFT result.

Specifically, violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities suggest the presence of quantum effects in macroscopic systems. Long-baseline neutrino experiments provide some of the longest available propagation distances over which such tests can be performed. Previous studies of Leggett-Garg tests in the neutrino sector have largely focused on showing that the oscillation probabilities can violate classical bounds for certain parameter choices. In this work, we develop a more complete and data-driven framework that treats both the distributions representing the classical and quantum behavior, as well as the experimental uncertainties. We consider MINOS, T2K, NOvA, as well as the upcoming DUNE, and present the respective statistical significance for distinguishing quantum behavior from classical scenarios at these long-baseline neutrino experiments. Among them, we find that T2K yields the most significant violation of classicality, at the level of $\\sim 14 \u03c3$, with NOvA and projections for DUNE also resulting in a significance of more than $5\u03c3$.",

At each temperature, we employ three large, fine lattices, which enables controlled continuum extrapolations of the energy-momentum tensor correlators. Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $\u03b7/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T>T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $\u03b6/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied.",

In these new variables, the Hamiltonian constraint reduces to a quadratic function with no potential term. Its quantum realization leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation reminiscent of the massless Klein-Gordon case. As an illustrative example, we consider the action of a tachyonic field and investigate the conditions under which a phantom crossing can occur as a quantum tunneling effect.

Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.",

While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena.",
