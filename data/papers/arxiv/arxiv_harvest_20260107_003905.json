      "summary": "Astrophysical dynamos feature various spatial structures and dynamical regimes, ranging from hemispherical magnetic fields to the random reversals of the geodynamo. The recently observed Tayler-Spruit dynamo has been invoked to explain angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones and magnetar formation in a proto-neutron star spun-up by fallback accretion. Whether this dynamo mechanism can lead to different dynamical regimes remains an open question. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the dynamics of a stably stratified spherical Couette flow, with the outer sphere rotating faster than the inner one. While the generation of strong stationary and hemispherical dynamos has been observed in our previous studies, we report for the first time the existence of reversals and complex temporal dynamics. We observe that the dynamics is strongly correlated with the equatorial symmetry breaking of the flow. Focusing on a fiducial dynamo simulation, we propose a simple interpretation of its dynamics, which consists in the coupling of two large-scale magnetic modes with two opposite equatorial symmetries by the flow symmetry breaking. While this interpretation captures the simplest observed dynamics, the nonlinear interaction between a higher number of magnetic modes is certainly required to describe some of the more complex regimes. The wide diversity of dynamical regimes generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may have interesting implications for the geometry of the neutron star magnetic fields, and therefore neutron star emissions.",

      "summary": "Wave propagation in a coherently oscillating background is intrinsically a periodically driven problem. We show that photon propagation through an axion dark matter background in the presence of a magnetic field is governed by Floquet physics, distinct from conventional static or adiabatic mixing paradigms. Coherent photon-axion mode conversion occurs when the mismatch between the photon and axion dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $\u0394_\u03b3- \u0394_a \\approx n m_a$ ($n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) with the axion mass $m_a$, even far from the standard level-crossing condition $\u0394_\u03b3\\approx \u0394_a$. Crucially, this resonance disappears entirely if the axion oscillations are averaged over, and is therefore systematically missed in conventional static or adiabatic treatments. This driven resonance represents a unitary Floquet mode-mixing process and is fundamentally distinct from parametric instability or stimulated axion decay, preserving the axion dark matter number density. We develop a general Floquet framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds, revealing that resonant mixing generates robust polarization effects during propagation. As an astrophysical application, we apply this mechanism to the realistic environment of the blazar 3C 279 to derive concrete constraints on the axion-photon coupling. While the observational manifestation depends on environmental conditions, the underlying driven mixing mechanism is generic to coherent axion dark matter, revealing a previously overlooked regime of photon-axion conversion.",

      "summary": "Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \\approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.",

      "summary": "IceCube observations point to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as promising contributors to the observed astrophysical neutrino flux. Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $\u03c3_{\\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\\sim 1$~PeV, provided that $\\sim$10\\% of the AGN coronae have $\u03c3_{\\rm p} \\sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations. Coronal emission is suppressed at higher energies by pion and muon cooling, so that another population is required, with jetted AGN being strong candidates.",

In view of the upcoming next generation of ground-based detectors, it is crucial to keep improving theoretical predictions to harvest the full scientific returns from these investments. We introduce here a substantial update of our Lagrangian numerical relativity code SPHINCS_BSSN. Apart from changing our unit system, we add constraint damping terms to the BSSN spacetime evolution equations. We demonstrate that this measure reduces, without noteworthy computational cost, the Hamiltonian constraint violations by more than an order of magnitude. We further implement contributions to thermal energy and pressure that are based on Fermi liquid theory and contain a parametrization of the Dirac effective mass. These terms can be combined with any cold equation of state, and they enhance the physical realism of our simulations and introduce a physics-based concept of a temperature. In a set of merger simulations, we demonstrate good agreement with other temperature-dependent numerical relativity simulations. We find that different parametrizations of the Dirac effective mass can translate into shifts of $\\sim 150$ Hz in the dominant post-merger gravitational wave peak frequency.",

Extending our previous work that highlighted the significance of secondary inverse Compton (IC) emission from annihilation-produced electrons, we expand the analysis to a broader range of WIMP masses and introduce a more realistic spatially-dependent modelling framework for the GC environment. This approach incorporates complexities such as the three-dimensional DM distribution, spatially varying radiation and magnetic fields, and electron transport mechanisms like Galactic winds and diffusion. We assess the impact of these environmental factors on both the spatial and spectral characteristics of the resulting secondary emissions. Our results demonstrate the robustness and necessity of incorporating this emission, and highlight its role in enhancing the prospects for detecting heavy WIMPs through observations of the inner Galaxy. We provide the resulting data products to the community to support future analyses and observational studies.",

In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework utilizing a ResNet-50 encoder pre-trained via supervised contrastive learning to classify CCSN signals and distinguish them from instrumental noise artifacts. Our approach explicitly optimizes the feature space to maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Using a simulated four-detector network (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA) and realistic datasets injecting magnetorotational and neutrino-driven waveforms, we demonstrate that the contrastive learning paradigm establishes a superior metric structure within the embedding space, significantly enhancing detection efficiency. At a false positive rate of $10^{-4}$, our method achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of nearly $100\\%$ for both rotational and neutrino-driven signals within a distance range of $10$--$200$~kpc, while maintaining a TPR of approximately $80\\%$ at $1200$~kpc.

In this system, two distinct modes of density fluctuations, referred to as the charged mode and the neutral mode, are theoretically expected to arise through parametric instabilities. Our simulations confirm these predictions: in the charged mode, the electron and positron densities fluctuate oppositely (Langmuir-like), while in the neutral mode, the charge is Debye-screened and both species fluctuate in phase (acoustic-like). The linear growth rates obtained from the simulations are in good agreement with analytical estimates for both modes. We also find that, in some cases, the linear growth saturates before full scattering occurs, allowing the incident wave to propagate without significant attenuation. Our results allow us to determine whether induced Compton scattering grows linearly in magnetized pair plasmas, offering a foundation for studies of fast radio bursts and laser-plasma experiments.",

      "summary": "The detection and characterization of post-merger gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star mergers remains challenging with current ground-based detectors. We present a convolutional neural network framework designed for real-time detection and multi-mode frequency extraction of post-merger signals, achieving an inference latency of 3.0 ms and a frequency accuracy of 48.6 Hz on the direct-comparison subsets (53 Hz on the comprehensive test set). The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate. These exceptional performance metrics arise from an aggressive training augmentation strategy that exposes the network to artificially challenging conditions, enabling robust generalization to our synthetic O4 detector noise model. We compare performance against a simplified matched filtering baseline using Lorentzian templates (23x more accurate despite a 4.7x computational overhead) and Bayesian parameter estimation (1.2 million times faster), establishing complementary trade-offs in the analysis landscape. While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to ~20 Mpc (~1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events. Our validation framework identifies expected behavior in uncertainty scaling that reflects realistic training constraints rather than idealized Fisher information limits, demonstrating honest assessment practices for machine learning applications in gravitational wave astronomy.",

We investigate the contribution of magnetars to the local ultra heavy cosmic ray flux using semi-analytic Galactic transport calculations, demonstrating that they may be significant contributors throughout Galactic history depending on the giant flare rate and ion acceleration efficiency. Although neutron star mergers inject orders of magnitude more energy into cosmic rays, they rarely occur within the spallation-limited propagation horizon for ultra heavy species, reducing their local contributions. As compared to lighter nuclei which are dominantly accelerated by supernovae, the SuperTIGER experiment has presented tentative evidence for a distinct contribution to the cosmic ray abundances near and above the first $r$-process peak ($Z \\approx 35\\text{--}56$). We argue that current abundance data are consistent with either a magnetar giant flare or neutron star merger origin for these species.

Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $\u03b7_p\\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity.

      "summary": "We develop a model of particle energization and emission from strongly turbulent black-hole coronae. Our local model is based on a set of 2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations with an electron-ion plasma composition, injection and diffusive escape of photons and charged particles, and self-consistent Compton scattering. We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow.",

      "summary": "Magnetar flares are highly energetic and rare events where intense high-energy emission is released from strongly magnetised neutron stars. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.",

General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \\lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios.",

Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor. We present highly magnetized, weakly magnetized, and non-magnetized pre-collapse stars, and discuss the observational implications for lGRB jets.",

      "summary": "Gravitational wave echoes offer a unique probe of the near-horizon structure of astrophysical black holes, beyond the standard ''black hole spectroscopy''. Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.",

The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \\textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition.",

      "summary": "The \\(w_{\\dagger}\\)VCDM framework provides a theoretically well-controlled extension of \\(\u039b\\)CDM within the class of minimally modified gravity theories, allowing for flexible cosmological background evolution and linear perturbation dynamics while remaining free of pathological instabilities. In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \\textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \\(\\sum m_\u03bd< 0.11~\\mathrm{eV}\\) (95\\% CL) and \\(N_{\\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \\(H_0\\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \\(w_{\\dagger}\\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.",

We compute the critical and virial overdensities and use these to evaluate the halo mass function within several commonly employed formalisms. Building on the reaction method, we develop a flexible and accurate framework for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum across a broad class of viable modified gravity models within luminal Horndeski theories. The framework interfaces seamlessly with EFTCAMB and is applicable to both covariant Horndeski models and effective field theory descriptions of dark energy, allowing for a range of background cosmologies. This approach enables systematic exploration of a wide space of theories and cosmological parameters, with the goal of informing future analyses of upcoming large-scale structure surveys.",

      "summary": "The Euclid mission seeks to understand the Universe expansion history and the nature of dark energy, which requires a very accurate estimate of redshift distribution. Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering.",

      "summary": "The statistical tension between early and late universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) suggests that the dark sector is dynamical rather than static. We propose that this dynamics arises from a fundamental symmetry principle: the Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance. We introduce the Dilaton ($\u03c7$), a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) associated with dilatation symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that a simple quadratic mass term in the fundamental theory transforms, via conformal coupling to gravity, into a ''thawing'' exponential potential $V(\u03c6) \\propto e^{-\u03bb\u03c6}$ in the Einstein frame. Using recent Bayesian reconstructions of dark energy dynamics from Planck, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data, we constrain the potential slope to be $\u03bb\\approx 0.056$. We show that this observational value is not arbitrary but corresponds to a fundamental non-minimal coupling strength of $\u03be\\approx 7.8 \\times 10^{-4}$. The Dilaton mechanism naturally generates the late-time equation of state evolution ($w_0 \\approx -0.85$) required to alleviate the Hubble tension while protecting the field mass $m \\sim H_0$ through approximate shift symmetry.",

Although the model remains highly successful when confronted with individual datasets, joint analyses expose a network of tensions involving the Hubble constant, CMB lensing, curvature, neutrino masses, and the nature of dark energy. In this contribution to the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106), within the context of Working Group~2, we critically assess these discrepancies, emphasizing the role of model assumptions, parameter degeneracies, and dataset consistency. We review proposed early- and late-time solutions, discuss how recent DESI BAO results alter the viability of late-time extensions, and explore interacting dark-sector scenarios. Our analysis highlights the need for caution in interpreting cosmological measurements and underscores the importance of internal consistency among cosmological probes before claiming percent-level accuracy or invoking new physics.",

      "summary": "Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w_{\\mathrm{dm}} = w_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from \"standard\" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $\u039b$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w_2 < 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.",

From these data, the amplitude of possible microlensing variability does not exceed 10 mmag on a 7-yr timescale. Additionally, we measure a time delay of $t_{AB}$ = 52.2$\\pm$2.5 days, with the brighter image A leading. Long-slit \\WHT spectroscopy refines the quasar redshift to $z_s$ = 1.791 and provides the first measurement of the lens redshift, $z_d$ = 0.473. The flux ratios of the quasar images in the MgII $\u03bb$2800 emission line and in the adjacent continuum are nearly identical, indicating minimal microlensing effects in the spectral domain, which is consistent with the very weak microlensing signal in the time domain. Using precise astrometry from recent HST imaging and the MgII flux ratio, we also built two simple mass models for the lens system. The close agreement between the measured delay and those predicted by the mass models, measured redshifts, and a concordance $\u039b$CDM cosmology, confirms the robustness of our results and highlights PS J2305+3714 as a promising system for future time-delay cosmography.",

      "summary": "Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe millions of binary black hole mergers, a fraction of which will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters, producing multiple images with characteristic distribution of time delay. Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $\u039b$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\\odot}$ is constrained to be $\\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\\%$ confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.",

      "summary": "The nature of dark energy (DE) remains elusive, even though it constitutes the dominant energy-density component of the Universe and drives the late-time acceleration of cosmic expansion. By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical\" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.",

      "summary": "We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the Hubble constant within the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), focusing on the standard $\u039b$CDM model and its dynamical dark energy extensions described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, both with and without massive neutrinos. By embedding the cosmological background equations directly into a Bayesian PINN architecture, we reconstruct the Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ in a data-driven yet physically consistent manner, while rigorously propagating epistemic uncertainties. Our analysis combines late-time observational probes, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO DESI DR2), and the Pantheon supernova sample, and quantifies the resulting tension in the inferred Hubble constant with respect to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and the SH0ES (R22) local distance ladder measurement. Within $\u039b$CDM, we find that data combinations involving BAO tend to favor lower values of $H_0$, alleviating the tension with Planck at the expense of increased disagreement with SH0ES. Allowing for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the CPL framework systematically shifts the posterior of $H_0$ toward higher values, leading to a notable reduction of the SH0ES tension, particularly for combinations including supernova data. The most flexible scenario, CPL with a free total neutrino mass $\u03a3m_\u03bd$, yields a balanced reconciliation between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, with tension levels typically reduced to the $\\sim1$-$2\u03c3$ range relative to both Planck and SH0ES. Our results highlight the nontrivial interplay between dark energy dynamics and neutrino mass in addressing the Hubble tension and demonstrate the efficacy of Bayesian PINNs as a robust and versatile tool for precision cosmology beyond the standard paradigm.",

In these models, the particles running in the loop are distinguished from the standard model due to an imposed $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the loop particles are odd. Therefore, the lightest particle running in the loop can be a viable dark matter candidate. In this paper, we revisit the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model and study the anatomy of right handed neutrino (RHN) DM relic, taking into account contributions from self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, as well as production via the freeze-in mechanism. We impose the constraints from direct detection and collider searches of DM including anomalous magnetic moment of muon, charged lepton flavor violation and low-energy neutrino oscillation data to show that the lightest RHN can be a viable DM in the mass range: $M_{h}/2\\lesssim M_{\\rm DM}\\lesssim2000 {\\rm GeV}$ (thermal DM) and $0.1 ~{\\rm GeV}\\lesssim M_{\\rm DM}\\lesssim 1000 {\\rm GeV}$ (non-thermal DM), where $M_h$ denotes the Standard Model Higgs mass and $M_{\\rm DM}$ is the RHN dark matter mass.

For Majorana dark matter annihilation into light fermions, the s-wave part of the annihilation cross section is helicity-suppressed, making the p-wave contribution dominant. We study the velocity-dependent p-wave annihilation case, whose resulting energy injection can modify the thermal and ionization history of the Universe, leaving observable imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum and the global 21-cm signal. From the predicted energy injection into the plasma, we derive stringent upper limits on the fraction of dark matter in form of PBHs for p-wave annihilation models, based on the observational constraints of the CMB spectral distortions ($y$-type), and from the measurement of the 21-cm absorption signal at cosmic dawn. Our results highlight that accounting for the p-wave nature of annihilation is crucial for deriving robust constraints on the PBH abundance.",

However, the unique characteristics of space missions pose distinctive challenges for separating the stochastic background from instrumental noise. To address the data analysis requirements, we develop a preliminary pipeline to search for the SGWB and evaluate its performance with Taiji simulation datasets. At present, we demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully recover the parameters of injected background with a known spectral density after setting aside the complication of galactic binaries foreground.

In contrast to standard leptogenesis via freeze-in, our mechanism works even in the presence of a single RHN around the GeV scale. The mechanism is illustrated for the minimal type-I seesaw with two RHNs, where we show that successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis is viable in large regions of parameter space even without a small mass splitting between the RHNs.",

These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog -- containing basic properties of the host halos -- into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables.",

Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed. These deviations can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon, but this is accompanied by correlated shifts in the matter density. The reconstructed expansion history remains close to LCDM at late times. Model comparison suggest that the interacting scenario is statistically competitive but not decisively preferred by current background data.",

Detecting these weak, secondary temperature anisotropy signals of the CMB requires accurate theoretical predictions of their amplitude across cosmological models. By extending the pyGenISW package, previously limited to $\u039b$CDM, we aim to generate full-sky ISW maps for a suite of 791 $w$CDM cosmologies using the Gower Street N-body simulations, thereby enabling ISW analyses across a broader dark-energy parameter space. We make our code and ISW data publicly available. We compute the ISW signals by tracing the time evolution of the gravitational potential across large-volume simulations that span dark energy equation of state parameters from phantom to quintessence, $-1.79 \\lesssim w \\lesssim -0.34$. These data are projected onto the sphere using HEALPix to obtain full-sky temperature maps. We validate our pipeline by comparing the measured ISW angular power spectra and ISW-density cross-correlations against linear theory expectations ($2 \\leq \\ell \\leq 200$) computed with benchmarks from the pyCCL library. The agreement is excellent across the multipole range where the ISW contribution is expected to dominate, confirming the reliability of our modelling of gravitational-potential evolution. With additional tests of the ISW signal's strength in density extrema, as well as comparing all models to a reference $\u039b$CDM cosmology, we found that quintessence-like models ($w > -1$) show higher ISW amplitudes than phantom models ($w < -1$), consistent with enhanced late-time decay of gravitational potentials. The consistency of our $w$CDM ISW maps and their agreement with theory predictions confirm the robustness of our methodology, establishing it as a reliable tool for theoretical and observational ISW-LSS analyses.",

Recent experiments on the Joint European Torus (JET) have explored this scenario at higher pre-disruptive plasma currents than are achievable on other devices, revealing challenges in obtaining benign terminations at $I_p \\geq 2.5$ MA. This work analyzes the evolution of these high-current RE beams and their terminating MHD events using fast magnetic sensor measurements and EFIT equilibrium reconstructions for approximately $40$ JET and $20$ DIII-D tokamak discharges. On JET, unsuccessful non-benign terminations occur at low edge safety factor ($q_{\\text{edge}} \\approx 2$), and are preceded by intermittent, non-terminating MHD events at higher rational $q_{\\text{edge}}$. Trends in the internal inductance $l_i$ indicate more peaked RE current profiles in the high-$I_p$ non-benign population, which may hinder successful recombination through re-ionization. In contrast, benign terminations on JET typically occur at higher $q_{\\text{edge}} \\geq 3$ and exhibit less peaked RE current profiles. DIII-D displays a range of terminating edge safety factors, correlated with the measured $l_i$ values. Across both tokamaks, the RE current peaking is therefore found to determine which MHD instability boundary is encountered, confirmed by linear resistive MHD modeling with the CASTOR3D code. Measured growth rates are similar for benign and non-benign cases, indicating that ideal MHD timescales at low density after hydrogenic injection do not alone explain efficient RE deconfinement. Instead, non-benign cases are characterized by their lower MHD perturbation amplitudes $\u03b4B$. These observations suggest that the interplay between ideal and resistive dynamics governs the termination process.",

      "summary": "The present paper sketches a framework for solving the wave and Fokker-Planck equations in the ion cyclotron resonance frequency domain fully selfconsistently. It illustrates this can be done by first constructing \"building blocks\" that are commonly needed by the wave and Fokker-Planck equations, allowing e.g. to account for wave coupling in plasmas containing non-Maxwellian distributions. Up to details, the paper exploits known expressions and methods to solve the two intimately connected aspects of the description of the wave-particle interaction underlying ion cyclotron resonance heating. Two cases are presented: the case where the guiding centre motion is limited to just following magnetic field lines, and the extended case accounting for drifts away from magnetic surfaces but assuming axisymmetry. A limited set of analytical results is included. As combining wave and Fokker-Planck solving is the focus, the computation of the dielectric response for arbitrary distribution functions is illustrated as well.",

      "summary": "Semiconducting Barrier Discharges (SeBDs) generate uniform ionization waves in air at atmospheric pressure. In this work, we investigate how externally applied irradiation synchronized with the discharge can mimic photoconductive-type coupling between the plasma and the semiconductor surface. By illuminating the Si-SiO$_2$ interface with nanosecond pulsed irradiation at wavelengths from 532 nm to 1064 nm, and using fast imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the photoexcitation of charge carriers in silicon enhances the plasma emission and increases the reduced electric field, with no detectable change in the electrical energy. The magnitude and thresholds of these responses depend on wavelength. By comparing the SeBD to a MOS photodetector, this behaviour can be explained by the absorption length. This length determines whether carriers are photogenerated inside the depletion region at the SiO$_2$-Si interface, where they are efficiently separated and undergo impact-ionization amplification, or deeper in the silicon bulk where carrier separation is weaker and free-carrier absorption diminishes the quantum efficiency. These results focus on the microscopic processes governing the plasma-semiconductor coupling and demonstrate how the optoelectronic properties of silicon can influence surface ionization waves.",

The partially ionized plasma is characterized by a significant presence of neutral particles in contrast to fully ionized plasma. The theoretical analysis is based upon solutions of the kinetic Boltzmann equation yielding the non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function (EEDF) thereby emphasizing the difference with a fully ionized plasma. The impact of the effect on discharges in inert and molecular gases is described in detail yielding the complex nonlinear phenomena in plasma self-organization. A few examples of such phenomena are given including the non-monotonic EEDFs in the discharge afterglow in mixture of argon with the molecular gas NF3; the explosive generation of cold electron populations in capacitive discharges, hysteresis of EEDF in inductively coupled plasmas. Recently, highly advanced computer codes were developed in order to address the outstanding problems of plasma technology. These developments are briefly described in general terms.",

This method is particularly advantageous for Magnetized Target Fusion applications as it yields a time-resolved diagnostic and does not require direct line-of-sight to the plasma or collimation of the neutrons. The instrumentation configuration, pulse-shape discrimination and pile-up correction algorithms, detector calibration, and ion temperature calculation method with uncertainty characterization are discussed.

      "summary": "Low-energy heavy-ion beams are fundamentally limited by severe space-charge divergence, which constrains the transportable beam current to a few microamperes in conventional electrostatic accelerators. This limitation is particularly critical for high-mass ions, where the generalized perveance increases rapidly because of their low velocity. Here, we demonstrate that this apparent space-charge limit can be overcome by shaping the electrostatic potential configuration of an existing multistage accelerator, thereby transforming the acceleration column itself into a combined acceleration-focusing column. By optimizing the interstage voltage configuration, a strong electrostatic lens effect is superimposed on the accelerating field to counteract space-charge-driven expansion. We formulate a generalized design framework that quantitatively maps the transport 'design window' in terms of beam current, ion mass, and acceleration voltage. For gold ions at 64 keV, this approach enables stable transport of beam currents exceeding 100 microA, more than an order of magnitude higher than the conventional limit. Numerical phase-space analysis shows that this improvement is achieved by prioritizing envelope control over emittance preservation, a trade-off intrinsic to space-charge-dominated regimes. Our results establish a universal and practical guideline for high-current heavy-ion beam transport, relevant to fusion plasma diagnostics, ion implantation, and massive molecular ion applications.",

We observe that the classical result of gravitational instability (also known as Rayleigh-Taylor instability) in fully ionized plasmas is significantly modified by the influence of ion-neutral collisions (with frequency $\u03bd_{\\rm{in}}$) and transverse wave numbers ($k_x$ and $k_y$). The instability growth rate can be enhanced or decreased depending on the values of the ratios $\u03ba\\equiv k_x/k_y$ and $f\\equiv\u03bd_{\\rm{in}}/\u03a9_{\\rm{ci}}$, where $\u03a9_{\\rm{ci}}$ is the ion-cyclotron frequency. We also estimate the growth rates relevant to the ionospheric E-region and solar atmosphere, noting that such growth rates can be maximized for $\u03ba,~f\\ll1$, or for $\u03ba>1$ and $f\\sim0.64$, and minimized for $f\\gg1$ irrespective of the value of $\u03ba$. Furthermore, the timescale of instability ranges from $1$ minute to $2$ minutes in the solar atmosphere, while in the E region, it ranges from $1$ minute to $80$ minutes. The latter can be a satisfactory result for the reported lifetime of solar prominence threads.",

We exploit the photonic properties of silicon to stimulate the SIW using external irradiation by a 2-ns pulsed laser at 532 nm, with a fluence of 1.3 mJ/cm$^2$ per pulse at the surface. No effect is observed when irradiation occurs more than 3 $\u03bc$s before plasma generation. This timescale is attributed to the ambipolar diffusion of photoexcited carriers away from the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. When this delay shortens to less than 3 $\u03bc$s, the SIW propagates farther and with more intense optical emission. Furthermore, the energy of the discharge increases by up to 7%. The sensitivity to the laser-plasma delay demonstrates that the observed stimulation of the SIW cannot be due to the desorption of surface charge by irradiation.",

Analytical modelling and particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the maximum amplification in wakefield amplitude is obtained when spatial separation equals the plasma wavelength (\u03bb_p). The spatial intervals between laser pulses critically influence the wakefield amplification.

While previous predictive studies of the low-current scenario indicated a robust safety margin against RE beam formation, this work reveals that the exponential scaling of the RE avalanche gain with plasma current severely narrows the safe operational window in the full power scenario. Using the non-linear magnetohydrodynamic code JOREK, we perform comprehensive 2D simulations of the current quench (CQ) phase of several disruption scenarios, systematically scanning initial RE seed currents and injected impurity levels. The results demonstrate that in the full power scenario, the avalanche multiplication factor is sufficiently high ($G_\\text{av} \\approx 1.3 \\cdot 10^5$) to convert a mere 5.5 A seed current into macroscopic RE beams of $\\approx 0.7$ MA when large amounts of impurities are present. For even higher RE seeds, the RE current can peak at $ \\approx 3.2$ MA, constituting up to $\\approx$ 80% of the total plasma current during the CQ. These findings suggest that, unlike the Day-0 phase, the disruption mitigation strategy for the full power scenario involves a careful balance between thermal load mitigation and RE avoidance, necessitating a well-chosen quantity of injected impurities. This work provides the baseline needed for future estimations of RE loads on the plasma-facing components of DTT, which will be essential for designing and positioning mitigation components like sacrificial limiters.",

A charged body moving through a dusty plasma medium can generate diverse nonlinear waves, such as precursors and pinned solitons. These wave excitations under weakly nonlinear and dispersive limits are described theoretically by the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) type equation. We have examined the role of the driver in shaping and evolving these wave excitations. In particular we studied the effect of primarily three source parameters, namely, amplitude, width, and flow speed, on the evolution of nonlinear structures. The driver generates a perturbation in the stable system configuration, which couples with medium characteristics and eventually evolves into propagating excitations. Our finding shows that the excitation of nonlinear structure by a moving body in a plasma medium is not just dictated by the mach number but also the features of the source such as amplitude and width. As a novel finding apart from pinned and precursor solitons, we observe another nonlinear structure that lags behind the source term, maintaining its shape and speed as it propagates. These features are the first ever theoretical depiction of such lagging structures.",

Relative to an axisymmetric equilibrium, the additional degree of freedom in a non-axisymmetric equilibrium manifests as a rotation of each shaping mode about the magnetic axis. Using this method, a shaping analysis is performed on non-axisymmetric configurations with precise quasi-symmetry and select cases from the QUASR database spanning a range of quasi-symmetry quality. Empirically, we find that quasi-symmetry results from a spatial resonance between shape complexity and shape rotation about the magnetic axis. The quantitative features of this resonance correlate closely with a configuration's rotational transform and number of field periods. Based on these observations, it is conjectured that this shaping paradigm can facilitate systematic investigations into the relationship between general flux-surface geometries and other figures of merit.",

Using 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with a co-evolving fluid-particle framework, we investigate how particle feedback affects reconnection and acceleration. Our simulations demonstrate that particle feedback to the fluid amplifies shear flows within magnetic islands, which strengthens the convective electric field and thereby boosts particle acceleration. This mechanism results in a higher maximum particle energy and a harder non-thermal energy spectrum. The guide field suppresses both the increase in gas internal energy and particle acceleration. These findings highlight the complex interplay between feedback, guide fields, and reconnection dynamics.",

High-fidelity edge fluid/neutral codes such as SOLPS-ITER capture SOL physics with high accuracy, but their computational cost limits broad parameter scans and long transient studies. We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions. Measured end-to-end wall-clock times show the surrogate is orders of magnitude faster than SOLPS-ITER, enabling rapid parameter exploration. Prediction accuracy degrades when the surrogate enters physical regimes not represented in the training dataset, motivating future work on data enrichment and physics-informed constraints. Overall, this approach provides a fast, accurate surrogate for computationally intensive plasma edge simulations, supporting rapid scenario exploration, control-oriented studies, and progress toward real-time applications in fusion devices.",

      "summary": "The efficiency of recombination is of crucial importance for the existence of ultracold plasmas, particularly, the ones formed in the magneto-optical traps. Unfortunately, a straightforward simulation of the recombination encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the \"virtual\" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such simulations, and it is necessary to employ some additional criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms (this might be a minimal number of revolutions of the electron about the nearest ion or a maximal distance between them). It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful ab initio simulation of the recombination without any auxiliary assumptions. We employed a special algorithm, which was based on: (i) using the \"scalable\" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding plasma, (ii) dynamical choice of the number of \"mirror\" cells, taking into account in calculation of the Coulomb sums, and (iii) accurate treatment of the singular interparticle interactions, without any truncation or \"softening\" of the Coulomb forces. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies for a sample of particles, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of the particle trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace formation of the real - rather than \"virtual\" - electron-ion pairs. The total efficiency of recombination for the realistic experimental conditions was found to be about 20%, which is in perfect agreement both with the laboratory measurements and with the earlier semi-empirical simulations.",

The confinement of cold energetic electrons produced near the hollow cathode plays a crucial role in guiding the plasma along the device axis. Experimental diagnostics reveal a high concentration of energetic electrons in the peripheral region near the source, which progressively converge toward the axis at a downstream location approximately 3.0 meters from the cathode. The length of the plasma column exhibits an inverse relationship with the electron-neutral collision frequency, indicating the significance of collisional damping in the propagation of energetic electrons. These observations are further supported by fluid simulations performed using COMSOL Multiphysics, which qualitatively reproduce the experimental trends. The results are consistent with a theoretical model previously proposed by the authors, reinforcing the understanding of energetic electron behaviour in magnetically guided plasma columns.",

Seed dormancy is a key factor influencing germination and seedling establishment. Three dormancy-breaking methods were compared: gibberellic acid, scarification and cold plasma. The efficiency and selectivity were evaluated through germination ability, time to 10% germination (T10), mean germination time and greenhouse emergence. Five days after imbibition, germination was only 18% for the untreated seeds but 60% for the plasma-treated seeds. Germination also began 24 hours earlier and mean germination time was reduced across most populations. However, there was a limited effect on seedling emergence, which remained around 55% for both untreated and treated samples. Comparative analysis indicates that cold plasma was more effective in alleviating embryo dormancy. In addition, histological and scanning electron microscopy showed that the seed coat differed according to the geographical origin of the populations, with a deeper dormancy in seeds from Sicilian populations.",

      "summary": "Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\\rm e}$) is critical for non-equilibrium plasma applications ranging from hypersonic flight to plasma-assisted combustion. We recently proposed a thermodynamically consistent model for vibrational-electron heating [Phys. Fluids 37, 096141 (2025)] that enforces the convergence of $T_{\\rm e}$ to the vibrational temperature ($T_{\\rm v}$) at equilibrium. However, the original derivation was restricted to single-quantum transitions, limiting its validity to low-temperature regimes ($T_{\\rm e} \\lesssim 1.5$ eV). In this Letter, we generalize the model to include multi-quantum overtone transitions, extending its applicability to high-energy regimes. We demonstrate that previous models neglecting hot-band transitions incur a systematic heating error of $\\exp(-\u03b8_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm v})$, where $\u03b8_{\\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature. This error exceeds 40\\% when $T_{\\rm v}$ is greater than $\u03b8_{\\rm v}$, effectively preventing thermal relaxation. To correct this, we derive a formulation where the total heating rate is a summation of channel-specific cooling rates $Q_{\\rm e-v}^{(m)}$, each associated with a quantum jump $m$, scaled by a thermodynamic factor $\\exp(m\u03b8_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm e}-m\u03b8_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm v})$. This generalized model preserves thermodynamic consistency by ensuring zero net energy transfer at equilibrium.",

Interestingly, we explain the crucial role of gap's accuracy when treating seeds with CAP, especially to improve interaction between seeds and plasma and therefore ensure an efficient treatment. CAP significantly improved the germination rates of seeds of dormant and non-dormant sunflower genotypes under water stress, demonstrating its efficiency in alleviating seed dormancy and in improving germination under suboptimal conditions. Furthermore, greenhouse experiments demonstrated that plasma treatment also stimulated seedling development under water stress conditions. These findings highlight the potential of CAP treatment as an effective approach to promote the whole process of emergence of crop species.",

Electron \\b{eta} scans further demonstrate the emergence of kinetic ballooning modes (KBMs) at higher \\b{eta}, whereas an ITG-TEM hybrid turbulence dominates near experimental \\b{eta} values. Nonlinear simulations show that moderate FI pressure suppresses transport via zonal flow (ZF) shear, whereas strong FI drive weakens ZFs and enhances transport by destabilizing FI-BAEs.

The whole-area electrode achieves the highest output, with a 155 percent increase in power compared to the baseline partial electrode.

The model reproduces experimental measurements across pressure, magnetic field, and frequency ranges, and reveals a previously unresolved transient ionization stage characterized by a rapid density rise within ~10-4 s, accompanied by a two-peak electron temperature structure that governs the formation of the dense plasma core. By tracking the RF power flow and field topology, we characterize the transient redistribution of RF energy during ignition. A short-lived phase of localized energy deposition accompanies the onset of ionization, followed by an evolution toward helicon-like field characteristics together with rapid density growth and profile restructuring. Systematic parametric scans further reveal the sensitivity of this mode-coupling process to gas pressure, magnetic field strength, and driving frequency. These results provide a unified picture of the ignition and mode-transition physics in helicon plasmas and establish a predictive tool for the design and optimization of RF plasma sources across space propulsion, manufacturing, and fusion technologies.",

A benchmark with previous simulations at constant impurity fraction has been provided for three H-modes, spanning different plasma current and magnetic field values. For a scenario, additional simulations have been performed to account for uncertainties in the modeling assumptions. The predictions are nearly insensitive to changes in the top of pedestal W concentrations. Varying the Ar pedestal concentration has shown a small effect on the impurity peaking and nearly constant fusion gain values, due to multiple effects on pedestal pressure, main ion dilution and density peaking. The inclusion of rotation in ASTRA simulations has shown minimal impact on confinement and impurity transport predictions. An exploratory study has been provided with a first set of simulations treating D and T separately, experiencing a maximum fusion power at 55-45% DT fuel composition, and an asymmetric distribution with respect to the D concentration. All the results, including sensitivity scans of toroidal velocity and ion temperature and density gradients, highlighted that turbulent impurity transport prevails on the neoclassical component, aligning with previous ITER predictions, and suggesting that next generation devices like SPARC, operating at low collisionality, will experience low W accumulation.",

Despite extensive experimental and theoretical effort, predictive correlations between laser and target parameters and the resulting ion-beam properties remain an open research question, owing to the intrinsically multiphysics and strongly coupled nature of laser-plasma interactions. Here, we employ our unified multiphysics model that reproduces laser-solid interaction dynamics with accuracy exceeding 95% over a broad range of short- and ultrashort-pulse conditions. Using this model, we derive statistically validated scaling laws and probability maps that correlate proton, carbon, and oxygen ion cutoff energies, beam divergences, and ionization states to a wide set of laser and target parameters, including pulse duration, laser power, laser beam spot, target thickness, prepulse-main pulse interval, contrast, laser wavelength, and polarization. Continuous beam properties (cutoff energies and beam divergences) are described using multivariate regression with cross-validation, while discrete ionization states are analyzed using classification and regression tree (CART) methods, enabling nonlinear and threshold-dependent behavior to be captured. The resulting scaling relations, contour maps, and box plots elucidate the coupled roles of laser pulse, and target geometry in governing TNSA ion acceleration and charge-state formation. These results provide a predictive and physically interpretable framework for understanding and optimizing laser-driven ion sources across a wide parameter space.",

      "summary": "High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $\u03b3$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.",

      "summary": "Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field.   Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime.   Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches.   Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.",

Nanoflares analyzed in this study were generated self-consistently via prescribed photospheric motions in a 3D multi-strand simulation of a subset of active region magnetic flux. Energies and durations were quantified using three distinct methods. In this study, we investigated the correlation between nanoflare energies (E) and delays ($\u03c4_D$) using two non-parametric, rank-based statistical tests. Across all methods, results consistently show little to no correlation. This is further supported by the distribution of the exponent $\u03b1$ in the assumed relation $E \\propto \u03c4_D^\u03b1$, which peaks near zero, and by broad delay distributions within fixed energy bins. These findings are irrespective of whether delays are correlated with the energy of the preceding or subsequent event. They also hold for a subset of high-energy nanoflares. The absence of correlation suggests that nanoflare onset is not solely determined by a critical value of magnetic stress and may involve triggering by other events, perhaps related to a locally complex topology.",

Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfv\u00e9nic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfv\u00e9nic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.",

      "summary": "Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 \u03bcm), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 \u03bcm). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.",

Using the aspect ratio as a perturbation parameter, we compute particle trajectories sampled from the kinetic equilibrium distribution, confirming the overall stability of the solutions. However, under burning plasma conditions, chaotic dynamics emerge for particles with supra-thermal and even thermal energies. This destroys the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment. The exact consequences are unclear, but they could undermine the foundational assumptions of gyrokinetic modelling in burning plasmas. Nevertheless, these results suggest the possibility of unaccounted transport losses in future burning plasma operations. The interplay between turbulence and energetic particles in the presence of Hamiltonian chaos certainly warrants further investigation.",

Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.",

This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.",

A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\u03b2$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.",

Such activity can pose significant operational challenges for critical infrastructure operators, particularly those managing electricity transmission networks, satellite constellations, and aviation systems. Substantial progress has been made in understanding space weather and the potential exposure of infrastructure assets to severe events. We have seen few evaluations of the types of current mitigation strategies in use to reduce our shared vulnerability to this activity, motivating this study. Firstly, we fill an important literature gap by undertaking a systematic review of the range of space weather mitigation strategies for these three critical infrastructure sectors. Secondly, we contacted 303 critical infrastructure operators (50 power, 227 satellite, 26 aviation) for participation in an anonymous online survey or interview receiving 55 unique responses (18% response rate). To capture narratives of mitigation actions taken and impacts experienced over the solar maximum, qualitative interviews were then conducted with 33 operators. The results identified 91 potential mitigation actions within the sectors and found that 149 mitigation actions were enacted due to space weather forecasts and experienced impacts. This is one of the first exhaustive studies of space weather mitigation activities, and moves beyond the traditional focus on purely impacts.",

      "summary": "Fast and slow solar wind have distinct properties linked to their solar sources.Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind complicates the usual speed-based classification, especially at intermediate speeds. Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfv\u00e9nic streams: one fast wind, three Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfv\u00e9nicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfv\u00e9nic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfv\u00e9nicity relates to the solar source conditions.",

We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

      "summary": "Mars lacks a global intrinsic dipole magnetic field, but its interaction with the solar wind generates a global induced magnetosphere. Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations.",

      "summary": "In solar wind turbulence, the energy transfer/dissipation rate is typically estimated using MHD third-order structure functions calculated using spacecraft observations. However, the inherent anisotropy of solar wind turbulence leads to significant variations in structure functions along different observational directions, thereby affecting the accuracy of energy-dissipation rate estimation. An unresolved issue is how to optimise the selection of observation angles under limited directional sampling to improve estimation precision. We conduct a series of MHD turbulence simulations with different mean magnetic field strengths, $ B_0 $. Our analysis of the third-order structure functions reveals that the global energy dissipation rate estimated around a polar angle of $ \u03b8= 60^\\circ$ agrees reasonably with the exact one for $ 0 \\le B_0/b_{rms} \\le 5 $, where $b_{rms}$ denotes the root-mean-square magnetic field fluctuation. The speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle can be understood by the Mean Value Theorem of Integrals, since the spherical integral of the polar-angle component ($\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$) of the divergence of Yaglom flux is zero, and $\\widetilde{T_\u03b8}$ changes sign around 60$^\\circ$. Existing theory on the energy flux vector as a function of the polar angle is assessed, and supports the speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle. The angular dependence of the third-order structure functions is further assessed with virtual spacecraft data analysis. The present results can be applied to measure the turbulent dissipation rates of energy in the solar wind, which are of potential importance to other areas in which turbulence takes place, such as laboratory plasmas and astrophysics.",

To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and \u03b8_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.",

Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.",

There exists some ambiguity whether magnetodisc scattering or high-latitude Alfvenic acceleration best describes the observed properties of these injection signatures, and also to what extent arcs in the outer emission are related to injections. Many injection signatures are the result of the evolution of dawn storms; there is, however, limited evidence that non-dawn-storm injection signatures are sometimes present in the aurora. We use automatic detection of these discrete features, alongside data from Juno-UVS and in-situ measurements by other Juno instruments, to show that scattering likely accounts for most of the electron precipitation associated with injection signatures. Additionally, there is evidence that injection signatures can be classified into two types: dawn-storm and non-dawn-storm. Arc-like features in the outer emission show very similar properties to traditional blob-like injection signatures and may consist of sequences of injection signatures that have broadened into an arc via energy-dependent electron drift.",

      "summary": "A common occurrence in weakly collisional space plasmas is the unequal electron-ion temperatures. The pressure-strain interaction provides a mechanism-agnostic pathway for increasing plasma internal energy through spatiotemporally local isotropic compression and volume preserving deformation, yet its behavior under thermal disequilibrium is largely unexplored. We investigate this using five fully kinetic two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of undriven decaying turbulence by varying the initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio. By analyzing the species' internal energy density alongside a decomposition of the pressure-strain term, with a focus on the volume-preserving deformation that contains normal and shear contributions, we quantify how the initial temperature imbalance modifies the channels through which turbulence increases each species' internal energy density. The cumulative pressure-strain interaction tracks the change in internal energy for both electrons and ions, with the total deformation channel of energy conversion dominating. We discover that local changes to electron internal energy density are governed primarily by the shear deformation power density, concentrated in electron-scale current sheets, while the ion shear and normal deformation components cancel, yielding a much smaller net deformation power density that peaks around, rather than within, those electron-scale current structures. We find that the amplitudes and localization of deformation change, but preserve these qualitative trends. Together, these results show how thermal disequilibrium could shape species-dependent turbulent \"heating rate\", measured via pressure-strain interaction and approximated via only its shear deformation part, and provide a framework for interpreting energy evolution and conversion in space plasmas where unequal species temperature is the norm.",

SWPC selected a set of 38 historical events over the period of five years from 2012--2014 (33 events) and 2017--2019 (5 events). The overall three-year project consisted of multiple simulation validation studies for the entire event set (1292 simulations): (a) benchmark single map (operational version prior to May 2019) (b) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving WSA-ENLIL with 4 different model settings (c) single test simulation of a time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (d) single GONG map driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (e) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL. We report that for all 38 events, within each model version/settings combination, the CME arrival time error decreased by 0.2 to 0.9 hours when using a sequence of time-dependent zero-point corrected magnetograms compared to using single magnetogram input. Overall, for all events, when using the older uncorrected magnetograms, the CME arrival time error increased for all new model versions/settings combination compared to the benchmark. Notably for the 5 events in the period 2017--2019 when more reliable zero-point corrected magnetograms were available, the ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (median arrival realization) CME arrival time error decreased against all benchmarks. In this report we also discuss replicating the operational model, challenges in detecting CME arrival in simulations, and comparing zero-point corrected and uncorrected magnetogram inputs.",

We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.",

In this work, we built SEPNet, an innovative multi-task neural network that jointly predicts future solar eruptive events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and SEPs, incorporating long short-term memory and transformer architectures that capture contextual dependencies. SEPNet is a machine learning framework for SEP prediction that utilizes an extensive set of predictors, including solar flares, CMEs, and space-weather HMI active region patches (SHARP) magnetic field parameters. SEPNet is rigorously evaluated on the SEPVAL SEP dataset (whitman, 2025b), which is used to evaluate the performance of the current SEP prediction models. The performance of SEPNet is compared with classical machine learning methods and current state-of-the-art pre-eruptive SEP prediction models. The results show that SEPNet, particularly with SHARP parameters, achieves higher detection rates and skill scores while maintaining suitable for real-time space weather alert operations. Although class imbalance in the data leads to relatively high false alarm rates, SEPNet consistently outperforms reference methods and provides timely SEP forecasts, highlighting the capability of deep multi-task learning for next-generation space weather prediction.

Embedded rotational discontinuities sharply deflect the otherwise uniform field lines, producing localized, large-amplitude field reversals in one-dimensional profiles that closely resemble the ``switchbacks'' observed by the Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. This indicates that switchbacks, as seen in one-dimensional spacecraft time series, arise from traversals through strongly curved segments of open magnetic field lines.",

      "summary": "A previously developed multi-ion, two-stream Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) hydrodynamic model for plasmasphere refilling has been extended to incorporate self-consistent electron temperature evolution. The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms.",

These waves are a signature of the interplay between plasma microinstabilities and turbulent dissipation. We perform a mission-wide statistical survey of ion-scale waves observed by PSP, investigating if the waves correspond to specific free energy sources in the measured proton velocity distributions. We find that left-handed waves (LHWs) are frequently observed, with the fraction of time they are observed increasing closer to the Sun, reaching $\\sim$30\\%. Right-handed waves (RHWs) are less frequently observed, with the associated time fraction decreasing closer to the Sun. The observed LHWs are generally consistent with parallel propagating ion cyclotron wave (ICW) storms that occur continuously for extended periods of time. Turbulent energy spectra are consistently steeper when LHW storms are observed; these wave storms mediate the spatial transport of the free energy associated with temperature anisotropy. The observed RHWs are generally consistent with oblique and parallel fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs), and their observation is well correlated with enhanced proton parallel heat flux, which quantifies the presence of secondary proton populations. Using observations and the SAVIC machine learning instability identification algorithm, we identify a threshold on the proton heat flux beyond which FMWs are likely to be driven unstable by the proton beams. We are thus able to associate trends in the observed ion-scale waves with known sources of free energy for Encounters 3 through 24 of the PSP's prime science phase.",

This paper advances the hypothesis that a combination of microgravity and ultra-low temperature (near absolute zero) provides an almost \"ideal\" operating environment for quantum hardware. Under such conditions, gravitational perturbations, thermal noise, and vibrational disturbances are minimized, thereby significantly extending qubit coherence times and reducing error rates. We survey four leading qubit platforms - superconducting circuits, trapped ions, ultracold neutral atoms, and photonic qubits - and explain how each can benefit from a weightless, cryogenic setting. Recent experiments support this vision: Bose-Einstein condensates on the International Space Station (ISS) maintained matter-wave coherence far longer than on Earth, atomic clocks in orbit achieved record stability, and a photonic quantum computer deployed in space is demonstrating robust operation. Finally, we outline a proposed side-by-side experiment comparing identical quantum processors on the ground and in microgravity. Such a test would directly measure improvements in qubit coherence (T1, T2), gate fidelity, and readout accuracy when the influence of gravity is removed.",

      "summary": "Venus, in the absence of an intrinsic magnetic field, undergoes a direct interaction between its ionosphere and the solar wind. Previous missions, including Mariner, Venera, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), reported a recurring localized increase in electron density, often termed a \"bulge,\" at altitudes between 160 and 200 km. This study investigates this topside bulge using over 200 dayside electron density profiles derived from the Venus Radio Science experiment (VeRa) onboard the Venus Express (VEX). We employ an automated, gradient-based classification algorithm to provide a quantitative and reproducible method for identifying and categorizing the bulge morphology into three types. Type 1 profiles exhibit a distinct secondary peak above the main V2 layer. Type 2 profiles display a shoulder-like feature near the bulge altitude. Type 3 bulges are not visually apparent but can be identified through residuals obtained after subtracting a Chapman layer fit to the V2 peak. The bulge is detected in over 80\\% of the analyzed profiles, with a higher occurrence during periods of low solar activity and at lower solar zenith angles (SZA). Type 1 morphologies are only observed at low latitudes (within $\\pm 40^\\circ$). The peak altitude of the bulge negatively correlates with SZA, suggesting that thermospheric cooling toward the terminator significantly influences the bulge altitude. The occurrence patterns and morphological characteristics indicate that the bulge is likely influenced by external drivers, such as solar wind interaction, rather than being solely a result of local photochemical processes.",

To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\\perp/T_\\|\\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs. Finally, this paper underscores the importance of high-resolution observations of the solar wind velocity distributions around RDs.",

This study investigates how Landau damping modifies the nonlinear evolution of KAWs by solving a modified nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation that captures both dispersive and nonlinear effects. Without Landau damping, modulational instability drives rapid self-focusing into intense magnetic filaments, producing a turbulent cascade with $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling in the inertial range ($k_\\perp\u03c1_i<1$) that transitions to $k_\\perp^{-8/3}$ at sub-ion scales ($k_\\perp\u03c1_i>1$), here $k_\\perp$ is the wavevector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field and $\u03c1_i$ the ion thermal gyroradius. When Landau damping is included, magnetic structures are significantly suppressed, and the spectrum steepens to $k_\\perp^{-11/3}$ in the sub-ion range while the inertial range maintains $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling. The damping acts across all scales through resonant wave-particle interactions, efficiently transferring energy from waves to particles. Direct comparison with Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations shows that the observed kinetic range spectral slope falls between our undamped and damped simulation limits, consistent with an intermediate damping regime in magnetosheath turbulence. This agreement confirms that Landau damping is one of the primary mechanisms controlling turbulent energy dissipation at kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas.",

Analytical expressions for the diffusion tensor components in the Fokker-Planck equation that take this effect into account have been found. The equation was solved numerically in the case of magnetostatic turbulence. It has been demonstrated that the skin effect increases the mean free path of particles in turbulent plasma, thereby reducing its anomalous resistance. It also leads to anisotropy in particle scattering, resulting in anisotropy in their stationary velocity distribution, which increases as the screening parameter grows. Approximate analytical formulas for the effective mobility of charged particles and the electric conductivity of plasma with isotropic magnetostatic turbulence have been obtained.",

The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight.",

By formulating the geometric shape of the scattered wave spectrum in wave number space, where the velocity vector of the beam component and the wave vectors of the incident and scattered waves are arbitrary, it is demonstrated that the spectrum in 2D wave number space becomes asymmetric. The spectrum of scattered waves propagating in a specific direction is presented as a function of wavelength to show that the electron (ion) feature is amplified and becomes asymmetric or distorted when Buneman (ion acoustic) instability occurs. An additional simulation is conducted for a weak, linearly stable beam-plasma system with a hot beam, and confirmed that the obtained scattered wave spectrum shows asymmetric feature. The results are expected to be applicable to the interpretation of radar observations of ionospheric plasmas as well as CTS measurements in laboratory plasmas.",

      "summary": "The challenge of \\textbf{imbalanced regression} arises when standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) biases models toward high-frequency regions of the data distribution, causing severe degradation on rare but high-impact ``tail'' events. Existing strategies uch as loss re-weighting or synthetic over-sampling often introduce noise, distort the underlying distribution, or add substantial algorithmic complexity.   We introduce \\textbf{PARIS} (Pruning Algorithm via the Representer theorem for Imbalanced Scenarios), a principled framework that mitigates imbalance by \\emph{optimizing the training set itself}. PARIS leverages the representer theorem for neural networks to compute a \\textbf{closed-form representer deletion residual}, which quantifies the exact change in validation loss caused by removing a single training point \\emph{without retraining}. Combined with an efficient Cholesky rank-one downdating scheme, PARIS performs fast, iterative pruning that eliminates uninformative or performance-degrading samples.   We use a real-world space weather example, where PARIS reduces the training set by up to 75\\% while preserving or improving overall RMSE, outperforming re-weighting, synthetic oversampling, and boosting baselines. Our results demonstrate that representer-guided dataset pruning is a powerful, interpretable, and computationally efficient approach to rare-event regression.",

      "summary": "A central question for understanding interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) physics and improving space weather forecasting is how ICMEs evolve in interplanetary space. We have updated one of the most comprehensive in situ ICME catalogs to date, which now includes 1976 events from 11 space missions covering over 34 years, from December 1990 to August 2025. We have combined existing catalogs including magnetic obstacles and identified and added boundaries of an additional 807 (40.8%) events ourselves. With this catalog, we demonstrate the most extensive analysis to date of total ICME magnetic field values as a function of heliocentric distance. Parker Solar Probe has observed 6 ICMEs at $< 0.23$ au (until April 2025), and Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo have added more events near 0.3~au, bridging the major observational gap towards the solar corona. Our main result is that a single power law can describe the evolution of the mean total magnetic field (exponent value of $k=-1.57$) and maximum field ($k=-1.53$) in the magnetic obstacle (MO), from 0.07 to 5.4 au. Extending the power law to the solar photosphere reveals a strong inconsistency with magnetic field magnitudes observed in the quiet Sun and active regions by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively. We introduce a multipole-type power law with two exponents, $k_1=-1.57$, and $k_2=-6$, relating the ICME magnetic field magnitude to an average solar active region field strength. These results present important observational constraints for the evolution of ICMEs from the Sun to the heliosphere.",

It is found that the impact of nonthermal parameter \u03b1, external magnetic field \u03a9, obliqueness lz, wave speed U0, and the ion kinematic viscosity \u03b70 can significantly change the characteristics of the shock and solitary waves.

The magnetopause moves inward to ~ 4 RE, and at the same time, the two cusps manifest as nearly parallel emission ridges in X-Ray. As the interplanetary magnetic field reverses, the cusp ridges move to higher latitudes for ~ 10 minutes after the reversal.

      "summary": "In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations.",

A direct consequence of the obtained general formulas is the relationship between the acceleration-induced shear viscosity in flat space and the conformal quantum anomaly in curved space, pointing to a possible novel probe of the conformal anomaly in systems with extreme acceleration. Moreover, for conformal field theories, we explicitly show that globally entanglement viscosity saturates the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound.",

If we employ the naive definition of the 't Hooft loop in the Abelianized regime, the dyonic loop operators do not admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory. Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by employing the notion of screening for line operators, and we argue that the dyonic loops are screened by a defect known as the twist vortex, which is non-dynamical in the infrared effective theory but is dynamical in the original ultraviolet theory. The dyonic loops properly dressed by twist vortices admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory, and we reproduce the kinematic prediction of the Wilson-'t~Hooft classification using the $3$d monopole semiclassics. Furthermore, we apply our framework to the thermal deconfined phase to evaluate the dual string tension, elucidating the topological nature of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ domain walls. We confirm that the domain-wall state has the phase transition at $\u03b8=\u03c0$ in the thermal deconfined phase despite the fact that the bulk state is smooth there.",

With the help of an exact fermion propagator in a homogeneous electric background field at nonzero temperature and finite volume on the one hand, and an improved perturbative result on the other, we identify the origin of this disagreement. The equilibrium conditions for the system are discussed and the role of the thermodynamic ensemble used to describe the system is highlighted.

The fact that this generalized coherence time can significantly exceed the naive estimate implies an enhanced sensitivity for dark matter searches that accumulate data over extended observation periods.",

      "summary": "Recent developments in generalized symmetries have provided new insights into quantum field theories. Within this framework, photons can be understood as Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry. In this work, we develop an effective field theory that builds on this symmetry structure to describe the real-time dynamics of photons in insulating media at finite temperature. Combining the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism with the generalized coset construction, we formulate a symmetry-based effective action that incorporates both conservative and dissipative effects. The effective theory implements the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry, ensuring consistency with the fluctuation-dissipation relation and Onsager's reciprocal relations. Within this framework, we derive the entropy current associated with dissipative photon dynamics and demonstrate the non-negativity of its divergence, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. We also clarify the symmetry origin of the gauge redundancy in the unbroken phase within the Schwinger-Keldysh framework, relating it to strong and weak realizations of higher-form symmetries. Our results provide a model-independent effective description of photon dynamics in insulating media at finite temperature.",

      "summary": "The increasing scope and breadth of gravitational wave detectors is providing the opportunity to explore new parameters in gravitational-wave astronomy. Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists.",

      "summary": "An important step in using observations of gravitational waves from bounded sources is to relate the observed waveforms far away from a source to the local dynamics and environment of the source. To isolate and identify different features of the source, multipole expansion of radiation field as well as that of the source distribution is crucial. Unlike the waves on Minkowski background, those on de Sitter background do not have a convenient, close form relation among these multipoles of arbitrary order to draw general conclusions. This requires truncation to some multipole order to be employed and a consistency issue arises. This was flagged in \\cite{CHK} as emergence of disallowed $log(r)$ terms in certain asymptotic forms and a particular quadrupolar truncation was proposed which was consistent with the source conservation.   In \\cite{NKD80}, it was noticed that a truncated solution while satisfying the wave equation, may fail to satisfy the gauge condition. Truncation in a fully gauge fixed form should not generate the unwanted $log(r)$ terms. In this work, we clarify the consistency issue and also correct a couple of erroneous statements in \\cite{NKD80}. The consistency is analyzed by explicitly integrating the gauge conditions and the source conservation equations over the conformal time. This gives a general procedure for a consistent truncation. The procedure is applied to truncations of completely gauge fixed solution illustrating its consistency.",

We point out that sources cannot generically be defined in a compact domain due to fluctuations of the cosmic perfect fluid. For power law cosmologies, we obtain the exact Green's function necessary to solve for all metric perturbations in terms of a hypergeometric function, which matches with a Green's function derived earlier by Chu.

For the locally rotationally symmetric case, we analytically explore the stationary points of the field equations. The analysis reveals the existence of accelerating solutions in which the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar effectively play the role of a cosmological constant. As a result, both anisotropic and isotropic expanding solutions are recovered, along with the Minkowski spacetime. No scaling solutions are supported by the gravitational model. For the general anisotropic Bianchi I geometry with three distinct scale factors, we find that a class of compactified Kasner-like solutions is obtained. In addition, a new family of solutions follows, describing a two-dimensional splitting of the background geometry. This behavior is similar to the previously observed pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in higher-dimensional spacetimes.",

Further, we investigate the phase transitions and critical phenomena in Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at the critical points. Such black holes are characterized by its mass ($M$), the dilaton charge ($Q$), and the negative cosmological constant, $\u039b(<0)$. We define a dimensionless parameter $\u03b5=\\bar{J}/{\\bar{Q}^2}$ and express the mass, temperature, volume, and Gibbs free energy in terms of $\u03b5$ and its polynomials. Moreover, we numerically fit the data for the critical points and find that in the appropriate limit, the expressions for critical points would correspond to the respective critical points of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics. Such a study involves a systematic analysis of temperature, Gibbs free energy, and volume in the extended phase space. We provide an analytical verification of the nature of the phase transitions at the critical points by introducing the Ehrenfest equations. We also check that all three quantities, e.g., the specific heat at constant pressure, $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient, $\u03b1$, and the isothermal compressibility, $\u03ba_T$, diverge at the critical points. We find the $Prigogine$-$Defay$ ratio using the expressions of $C_P$, $\u03b1$, and $\u03ba_T$, and find that it identically equals unity. Hence, the phase transition behavior of the Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at their critical points is of second order. In addition, we propose investigating the energy extraction process via the Penrose process. Later, we calculate the speed of sound and adiabatic compressibility for the rotating Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes. Finally, on a specific note, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities of the boundary conformal field theory (CFT) dual to the extended phase space.",

However, the Lorentz-violating parameter $l$ induces distinct geometric effects: it suppresses the optical shadow radius by a factor of $\\sqrt{1-l}$ and hardens the quasinormal mode frequency by the inverse factor. Utilizing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for Sagittarius A*, and assuming the mass prior derived from stellar dynamics, we place a constraint of $l \\lesssim 0.19$. While the product of the shadow radius and ringdown frequency remains degenerate with General Relativity, the specific suppression of the shadow size offers a viable pathway to constrain Planck-scale physics with current and future horizon-scale imaging.",

Using the scalar vector tensor (SVT) decomposition and a decomposition of the perturbed Ricci tensor, we obtain a set of fully gauge invariant propagation equations that isolate the contributions of the scalar, vector, and tensor modes in the presence of matter. We find that the tensor sector retains the two transverse traceless polarizations of General Relativity, while the scalar sector supports a massive breathing-longitudinal mode determined by the massive scalar propagating mode. Through the geodesic deviation equation, computed both in a local Minkowski patch and in fully covariant de Sitter form, we independently recover the same polarization content and identify its tidal signatures.

To discuss the cosmological implications of the model, we consider a well-motivated logarithmic form of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. By deriving the cosmological evolution equations, we obtain the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and deceleration parameters. We analyze the behavior of the cosmological parameters by plotting their graphs against the redshift parameter ($z$). We observe that the equation of state parameter shows quintessence-like behaviour during present and future epochs; however, phantom-like behavior is also possible for suitable values of the model parameters. Analysis of the deceleration parameter shows a smooth recent phase transition of the universe (deceleration to acceleration). An interesting result we observe is the decelerated expansion of the universe in the far future, i.e, the universe experiences another phase transition in the future. The physical significance of the well-known cosmological plane ($w_D-w_D'$ plane) is discussed in our model. We observe that the trajectories start in the freezing region with the same initial behavior, deviate from each other during the evolution and ends in the thawing region.
