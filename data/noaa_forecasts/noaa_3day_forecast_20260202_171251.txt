A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 02-Feb 04 2026 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       2.00         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 02-Feb 04 2026

              Feb 02  Feb 03  Feb 04
S1 or greater   65%     50%     50%

Rationale: S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are likely on 02
Feb due to the eruptive X8.1 event that occurred late on 01 Feb. Chances
diminish slightly thereafter but remain at a high chance given the
history and potential currently exhibited by AR 4366.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 01 2026 2357 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 02-Feb 04 2026

              Feb 02        Feb 03        Feb 04
R1-R2           80%           80%           80%
R3 or greater   40%           40%           40%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flares
are expected to continue through 04 Feb, with a high chance of
occasional R3 (Strong) or greater events due to X-class flares, given
the history and flare potential currently exhibited by AR 4366.
