A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 08-Feb 10 2026 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 08-Feb 10 2026

             Feb 08       Feb 09       Feb 10

09-12UT       1.33         2.67         1.67     
12-15UT       2.00         2.67         1.67     
15-18UT       3.33         3.00         0.67     
18-21UT       3.33         3.00         1.67     
21-00UT       4.67 (G1)    3.67         2.00     

Rationale: Isolated G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels are likely on 08
Feb due to the anticipated arrival of a CME (from 03 Feb), in
combination with continued negative polarity CH HSS influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 08-Feb 10 2026

              Feb 08  Feb 09  Feb 10
S1 or greater   25%     25%     25%

Rationale: There is a chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton flux to
reach S1 (Minor) levels over 08-10 Feb due to the eruptive potential and
location of Region 4366.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 08 2026 1118 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 08-Feb 10 2026

              Feb 08        Feb 09        Feb 10
R1-R2           65%           65%           65%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: M-class flares (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) are likely, with a
chance for X-class flares (R3/Strong or greater) over 08-10 Feb,
primarily due to the eruptive potential of Region 4366.
