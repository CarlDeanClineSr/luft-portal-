A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Dec 28-Dec 30 2025 is 2.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Dec 28-Dec 30 2025

              Dec 28  Dec 29  Dec 30
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for a flux above the S1 threshold
due to the flaring potential of the active regions on the visible solar
disk.


C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Dec 28-Dec 30 2025

              Dec 28        Dec 29        Dec 30
R1-R2           45%           45%           45%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale:  Thee is a chance for R1/R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
on 28-30 Dec due to the flare potential of the current active regions.
There is a slight chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) event during the
3-day period.
