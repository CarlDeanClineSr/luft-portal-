A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 17-Jan 19 2026 is 5.33 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       4.67 (G1)    3.00         3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are expected on 17-18 Jan due
to influence from a positive polarity coronal hole.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 17-Jan 19 2026

              Jan 17  Jan 18  Jan 19
S1 or greater    5%      5%      5%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 17 2026 1029 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 17-Jan 19 2026

              Jan 17        Jan 18        Jan 19
R1-R2           60%           60%           60%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance of R3 (Strong), over 17-19 Jan due to the flare potential
from multiple complex regions on the solar disk.
