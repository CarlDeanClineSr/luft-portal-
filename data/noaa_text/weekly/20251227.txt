Highlights of Solar and Geomagnetic Activity
15 - 21 December 2025

Solar activity reached high levels on 19-21 Dec. There were three M1
flares from an unnumbered region beyond the east limb, Region 4315
(N19E58, L=35, class/area Bxo/10 on 20 Dec) and Region 4316 (S07E28,
L=45, class/area Dsi/50 on 21 Dec. Low levels with only C-class
activity was observed on 15-18 Dec. These two numbered regions also
produced numerous C-class flares. No significant CME activity was
observed on the Earth-facing disk. 

No proton events were observed at geosynchronous orbit.

The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached
high levels on 17-21 Dec due to coronal hole high speed stream
influences. Normal to moderate levels were observed on 15-16 Dec. 

Geomagnetic field activity reached G1 (Minor) storm levels on 17 and
21 Dec due to CH HSS influences. Active levels were observed on 18
Dec. Quiet to unsettled levels were observed on 15-16, and 19-20
Dec. 

Forecast of Solar and Geomagnetic Activity
22 December - 17 January 2026

Solar activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels for the
outlook period. 

No proton events are expected at geosynchronous orbit.

The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit is
expected to be at high levels on 25-29 Dec, 1-6 Jan, and 14-17 Jan.
All due to recurrent CH HSS influences. 

Geomagnetic field activity is expected to be at G2 (Moderate) storm
levels on 30 Dec; G1 (Minor) storm levels are expected on 22-23 Dec,
31 Dec, and 17 Jan, active levels are expected on 24-25 Dec, 01-02
Jan, 09-10 Jan, and 12-14 Jan. All due to recurrent CH HSS
influences.
