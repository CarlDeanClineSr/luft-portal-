A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 01-Mar 03 2026 is 3.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 01-Mar 03 2026

             Mar 01       Mar 02       Mar 03
00-03UT       2.67         3.33         2.00

18-21UT       3.00         3.33         2.00     
21-00UT       3.00         3.00         2.33     

Rationale: There is a chance for G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming
periods, on 01 Mar due to the anticipated arrival of a CME from 25 Feb,
followed by the onset of positive polarity CH HSS influences on 02 Mar.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 01-Mar 03 2026

              Mar 01  Mar 02  Mar 03
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 01-Mar 03 2026

              Mar 01        Mar 02        Mar 03
R1-R2           25%           25%           25%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is a chance for isolated R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts through 03 Mar.
