A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 26-Feb 28 2026 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 26-Feb 28 2026

             Feb 26       Feb 27       Feb 28
00-03UT       4.00         2.67         3.00

21-00UT       3.00         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 26-Feb 28 2026

              Feb 26  Feb 27  Feb 28
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 25 2026 1559 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 26-Feb 28 2026

              Feb 26        Feb 27        Feb 28
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater    5%            5%            5%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be at low levels through 28
Feb, with a high chance for isolated M-class activity
(R1-R2/Minor-Moderate), primarily due to the eruptive potential of
Region 4379.
