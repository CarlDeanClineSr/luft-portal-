A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 01-Feb 03 2026 is 1.67 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT       1.33         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 01-Feb 03 2026

              Feb 01  Feb 02  Feb 03
S1 or greater    5%      5%     10%

Rationale: S1 (Minor) or greater probabilities begin to increase on 03
Feb as Region 4366 rotates into a more favorable location for
connection.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R2 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 01 2026 1212 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 01-Feb 03 2026

              Feb 01        Feb 02        Feb 03
R1-R2           55%           55%           55%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flares,
with a slight chance for an isolated X-class event (R3 or greater), will
persist through 03 Feb given the evolution and history of Region 4366.
