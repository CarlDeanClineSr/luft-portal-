A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 02-Jan 04 2026 is 6.00 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Jan 02-Jan 04 2026

             Jan 02       Jan 03       Jan 04
00-03UT       3.00         5.00 (G1)    3.67     
03-06UT       4.00         6.00 (G2)    3.33     
06-09UT       3.33         6.00 (G2)    2.00     
09-12UT       2.33         4.67 (G1)    3.00     
12-15UT       2.00         4.00         3.00     
15-18UT       2.00         3.00         2.00     
18-21UT       2.33         3.00         3.33     
21-00UT       4.67 (G1)    4.33         3.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) storming levels are likely on 02 Jan due to the
combination of HSS activity and potential glancing blows from the 28-30
Dec CMEs. By late on 02 Jan to early on 03 Jan, the arrival of the 31
Dec CME is expected to cause likely G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) storming.
Additional geomagnetic storming is anticipated on 04 Jan with the
possible impact of the 02 Jan CME.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 02-Jan 04 2026

              Jan 02  Jan 03  Jan 04
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for a greater than 10 MeV proton
event today through 04 Jan.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 02-Jan 04 2026

              Jan 02        Jan 03        Jan 04
R1-R2           55%           50%           45%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
slight chance for R3 (Strong) events on 02 Jan. Levels are likely to
decrease to a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackout activity
and a slight chance for an isolated R3 (Strong) event on 03-04 Jan as
most regions on the visible disk continue to decay.
