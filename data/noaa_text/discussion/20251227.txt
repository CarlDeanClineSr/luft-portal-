.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity reached high (R2-Moderate) levels following an M5.1 flare
at 27/0150 UTC from an area just NW of Region 4323 (S12E54, Axx/alpha).
Accompanying this flare was a Type II radio sweep (est. 788 km/s) and an
F10.7cm radio burst (190 sfu). An associated CME was first observed in
LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery at ~27/0200 UTC, analyzed, and determined
to be a miss well behind Earth. Regions 4317 (N12W14, Eac/beta) and 4324
(N24E71, Dac/Beta) contributed to the flare activity with low-level
C-class flares throughout the period. Intermediate spot development was
noted in Region 4321 (S10W43, Dki/beta-delta) the latter half of the
period, with the remaining regions being unchanged or exhibiting slight
decay.

No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for M-class flares
over 27-29 Dec.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 8,194 pfu observed at 26/1655 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
27-28 Dec and return to normal to moderate levels on 29 Dec. The greater
than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at background levels
through 29 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters continued to slowly decrease as CH HSS effects
weakened. Solar wind speed decreased from approximately 550 km/s to 500
km/s, total field averaged near 6 nT, and the Bz component was between
+/-5 nT. Phi angle was predominantly positive.

.Forecast...
Solar wind parameters are expected to trend towards background levels on
27-29 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was at quiet to unsettled conditions.

.Forecast...
Mostly quiet levels are expected, with isolated unsettled periods
possible, on 27-29 Dec as CH HSS effects slowly diminish.
