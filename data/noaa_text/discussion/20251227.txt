Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was low. New Region 4323 (S12E61, Axx/alpha) produced a
majority of this periods activity. The largest flare was a C6.9
observed at 26/0914 UTC from Region 4323. Region 4317 (N11W06, Eai/beta)
produced a C2.2/Sf at 26/0815 UTC. Slight decay was observed in the
trailing spots of Region 4317.

Region 4321 (S10W36, Dki/beta-delta) continued to show growth and
consolidation into a large compact region with its leading polarity
almost north of its trailing polarity. The region formed a delta
configuration at the boundary of its leading and following spots. New
Region 4324 (N28E75, Dso/beta) was numbered. The rest of the numbered
regions were either stable or in decay.

No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for M-class flares
over 27-29 Dec.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 8,194 pfu observed at 26/1655 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
27-28 Dec and return to normal to moderate levels on 29 Dec. The greater
than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at background levels
through 29 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters were in decline as CH HSS effects diminished.
Solar wind speed decreased from approximately 550 km/s to about 500
km/s. Total field ranged from 2-6 nT while the Bz component was between
+/-5 nT. Phi angle was predominantly positive.

.Forecast...
Solar wind parameters are expected to be at mostly quiet levels on 27-29
Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was at quiet to unsettled conditions.

.Forecast...
Mostly quiet levels are expected on 27-29 Dec as CH HSS effects decay.
