Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was at low levels. The largest flare was a C8.6/1n at
22/2231 UTC from Region 4317 (N11E51, Eai/beta). Additionally, a C2.8
flare at 22/0914 UTC occurred, associated with a filament eruption in
the vicinity of Region 4316 (S08E10, Dai/beta-gamma). Modeling of the
ejecta from the event suggested no Earth-directed component was
produced. Region 4316 continued to increase in magnetic complexity with
a gamma configuration observed as it developed. Some minor growth was
also observed in Region 4317 and 4318 (N05E54, Dao/beta). Region 4319
(S08E66, Axx/alpha) was numbered but remained simple and inactive.

No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery. 

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with an increasing chance
for M-class flares over 23-25 Dec.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 1,882 pfu observed. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was
steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
23-25 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 24 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters reflected the influence of a strong, positive
polarity coronal hole high speed stream. Total magnetic field strength
decreased from ~10 nT during the CIR to ~6-7 nT as the high speed stream
set in. Solar wind speeds increased from ~700 km/s to a peak of ~800
km/s by midday. Speeds gradually decreased to ~725 km/s near the end of
the UT day. Phi angle was predominantly oriented in the positive sector
positive sector.

.Forecast...
Enhanced solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 23-25 Dec as
influence from the positive polarity coronal hole persists. Additional
enhancements are possible on 24 Dec due to a CME that is expected to
pass close to Earth which left the Sun on 20 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached G1 (Minor) storm levels due to effects
from the positive polarity coronal hole.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is likely to reach G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm
levels on 23 Dec due to persistent influence from the positive polarity
coronal hole. Periods of active conditions are likely on 24-25 Dec under
waning coronal hole effects, and possible influences on 24 Dec from a
CME (which left the Sun on 20 Dec) that is expected to pass in close
proximity to Earth.
