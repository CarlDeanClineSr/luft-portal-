Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was low. The largest flare was a C8.6/1n at 22/2231 from
Region 4317 (N10E43, Eki/beta-gamma). Moderate growth was observed in
the intermediate spots of Region 4317 along with consolidation of the
leader spots. Slight growth was also observed in Regions 4318 (N05E48,
Dai/beta) and 4319 (S09E61, Bxi/beta). New Region 4320 (N06E75,
Hsx/alpha) was numbered.

Other activity included a C2.8 flare that occurred at 22/0914 UTC
associated with a filament eruption near S14E33. The corresponding CME
off the E limb at 22/1036 UTC in SOHO/LASCO C2 imagery was modelled and
determined to not have an Earth-directed component.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with an increasing chance
for M-class flares over 23-25 Dec due to the return of old Regions 4294
(S15, L=284) and 4296 (S15, L=272). Last rotation, those regions
produced 17 M-class flares and 2 M-class flares, respectively.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 1,882 pfu observed at 22/1555 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
23-25 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 25 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Sola wind parameters continued to be enhanced under positive polarity CH
HSS influence. Solar wind speed ranged from approximately 660-800 km/s.
Total field ranged from 3-8 nT while the Bz component was between +5/-6
nT. Phi angle was mostly positive.

.Forecast...
Enhanced solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 23-25 Dec as
influence from the positive polarity coronal hole persists. Additional
enhancements are possible on 24 Dec due to a CME that is expected to
pass close to Earth which left the Sun on 20 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached unsettled to G1 (Minor) storm levels due
to effects from a positive polarity coronal hole.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is likely to reach G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm
levels on 23 Dec due to persistent influence from a positive polarity
coronal hole. Periods of active conditions are likely on 24-25 Dec under
waning HSS effects, and possible influences on 24 Dec from a CME (which
left the Sun on 20 Dec) that is expected to pass in close proximity to
Earth.
