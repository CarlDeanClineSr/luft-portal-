Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity briefly reached moderate levels due to an impulsive M1.0
at 19/1558 UTC that originated from a region just beyond the southeast
limb. Regions 4308 (N08, L=136) and 4310 (N03, L=177) decayed to plage,
while new spots were observed near N23E44 but remain unnumbered at this
time given their age and lack of growth since emergence. The remaining
active regions were either stable or showing signs of decay. No
Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be at low levels with occasional C-class
flares through 22 Dec.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 3,240 pfu at 19/1810 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux
was steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels
through 21 Dec before decreasing to normal to moderate levels on 22 Dec
with the arrival of a corotating interaction region ahead of faster
solar wind. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist
at background levels through 22 Dec given the lack of complex, energetic
active regions currently inhabiting the visible solar disk.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
The solar wind environment reflected waning negative polarity CH HSS
influences. Total field decreased from 5 nT to 2-4 nT while the Bz
component was benign at rougly +/- 5 nT. Solar wind speeds peaked near
670 km/s before gradually declining to about 500 km/s. Phi was
predominantly negative, but began undergoing oscillations into the
positive sector late in the period.

.Forecast...
The solar wind environment is expected to remain mildly enhanced over
20 Dec as negative polarity CH HSS influences diminish. Background
conditions are then expected to prevail on 21 Dec. An enhanced regime is
anticipated to return on 22 Dec due to recurrent, positive polarity CH
HSS influences.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
Geomagnetic field activity was at quiet levels.

.Forecast...
Geomagnetic field activity is expected to be at quiet levels with a
chance for isolated periods on 20 Dec as CH HSS effects continue to
diminish with quiet conditions then continuing on into 21 Dec. G1
(Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 22 Dec due to recurrent,
positive polarity CH HSS effects.
