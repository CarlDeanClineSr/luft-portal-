Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity reached moderate levels this period. Notable activity
included an M1.0 flare at 19/1558 UTC from a region beyond the southwest
limb, and an M1.1/Sf flare at 20/0753 UTC from new Region 4315 (N20E56,
Bxo/beta). New Region 4314 (N23E40, Bxo/beta) was also numbered, but was
quiet and otherwise unremarkable. The remaining active regions were
either stable or showing signs of decay. No Earth-directed CMEs were
observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with a slight chance for
M-class flares over 20-22 Dec.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 3,240 pfu observed. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was
steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels
on 20-21 Dec, before decreasing to normal to moderate levels on 22 Dec.
The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at background
levels through 22 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
The solar wind environment reflected waning negative polarity CH HSS
influences. Total field strength ranged between 1-5 nT, while the Bz
component varied between +/-4 nT. Solar wind speeds steadily declined
throughout the period from a peak near 550 km/s to around 475 km/s. Phi
transitioned from negative to positive at around 20/0110 UTC.

.Forecast...
Ambient solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 20-21 Dec. On
22 Dec, enhanced solar wind conditions are likely due to the anticipated
onset of CIR effects followed by positive polarity CH HSS influences.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was quiet throughout the period.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to be mostly quiet over 20-21 Dec.
Active conditions and periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming are
likely on 22 Dec due to the anticipated onset of CIR effects followed by
positive polarity CH HSS influences.
