Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was low. Weak C-class activity was observed from Regions
4316 (S08W03, Cso/beta) and 4317 (N10E35, Eki/beta-gamma). Moderate
growth was observed in the intermediate spots of Region 4317 along with
some consolidation of the leader spots. Slight growth was also observed
in Regions 4318 (N05E41, Dao/beta). New Region 4320 (N06E68, Hsx/alpha)
was numbered.

No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with an increasing chance
for M-class flares over 24-26 Dec due to the return of old Regions 4294
(S15, L=284) and 4296 (S15, L=272). During these regions last rotation,
they produced 17 M-class flares and 2 M-class flares, respectively.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 5,560 pfu observed at 23/1730 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
24-26 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 26 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Sola wind parameters continued to be enhanced under positive polarity CH
HSS influence. Solar wind speed averaged approximately 700 km/s. Total
field ranged from 4-7 nT while the Bz component varied between +/-5 nT.
Phi angle was predominately positive.

.Forecast...
Enhanced solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 24-25 Dec as
influence from the positive polarity coronal hole persists. Additional
enhancements are possible on 24 Dec due to a CME that is expected to
pass close to Earth which left the Sun on 20 Dec. Waning conditions are
expected on 26 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached unsettled to active levels due to effects
from a positive polarity coronal hole.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is likely to reach active conditions on 24-25 Dec
under continued CH HSS effects, and possible influences on 24 Dec from a
CME (which left the Sun on 20 Dec) that is expected to pass in close
proximity to Earth. Quiet to unsettled conditions are expected on 26 Dec
under waning CH HSS conditions.
