Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was at low levels. Low level C-class flaring was
observed from Regions 4319 (S09E27, Dro/beta) and 4321 (S10W23,
Dai/beta-delta). The largest region on the disk, Region 4317 (N12E09,
Eai/beta) exhibited decay in its trailing spots and consolidation of the
leader spots. Region 4321 continued to grow and appears to have
developed a delta magnetic configuration. New Region 4322 (N13W63,
Cro/beta) and was numbered 4322 this period. The rest of the numbered
regions were either stable or in decay.

No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with a slightly increasing
chance for M-class flares over 26-28 Dec due to the return of old
Regions 4294 (S15, L=284) and 4296 (S15, L=272).

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 8,651 pfu observed at 25/1450 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
26-28 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 28 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters were enhanced but in decline as CH HSS effects
began to diminish. Solar wind speed decreased from approximately 650
km/s to near 550 km/s. Total field ranged from 1-6 nT while the Bz
component was between +3/-5 nT. Phi angle was mostly positive.

.Forecast...
Gradually waning solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 26
Dec as influence from the positive polarity coronal hole decays.
Continued waning conditions are expected on 27-28 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached quiet to unsettled levels due to effects
from a positive polarity coronal hole.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to reach mostly quiet to unsettled
conditions on 26 Dec, under waning CH HSS effects. Mostly quiet levels
are expected on 26-27 Dec as CH HSS effects decay.
