Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was low. The largest flare was a C6.9 at 26/0914 from an
unnumbered region rotating around the SE limb near S09. Slight decay was
observed in the trailing spots of Region 4317 (N11E01, Eki/beta). Region
4321 (S10W29, Dkc/beta-delta) continued to show growth and consolidation
into a large compact region with its leading polarity almost north of
its trailing polarity. The rest of the numbered regions were either
stable or in decay.

No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for M-class flares
over 26-28 Dec due to the return of old Regions 4294 (S15, L=284) and
4296 (S15, L=272).

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 8,651 pfu observed at 25/1450 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
26-28 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 28 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters were in decline as CH HSS effects diminished.
Solar wind speed decreased from approximately 600 km/s to near 530 km/s.
Total field ranged from 1-6 nT while the Bz component was between +5/-4
nT. Phi angle was predominantly positive.

.Forecast...
Gradually waning solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 26
Dec as influence from the positive polarity coronal hole decays.
Continued waning conditions are expected on 27-28 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was quiet.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to reach mostly quiet with isolated
unsettled periods on 26 Dec, under waning CH HSS effects. Mostly quiet
levels are expected on 27-28 Dec as CH HSS effects decay.
