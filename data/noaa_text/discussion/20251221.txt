Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity reached moderate levels this period. Notable activity
included an M1.1/Sf flare at 20/0753 UTC from new Region 4315 (N20E49,
Bxo/beta), which was accompanied by a type II radio sweep with an
estimated speed of 558 km/s. The subsequent CME associated with this
event was modeled and determined to mostly be a miss passing behind
Earths orbit, but with a small chance for glancing influences possibly
materializing by late on 24 Dec. New Region 4314 (N23E40, Bxo/beta) was
also numbered, but was quiet and otherwise unremarkable. Additionally,
Regions 4316 (S00E40, Dao/beta) and 4317 (N13E73, Dao/beta) were
numbered as well with the former undergoing rapid flux emergence and
development.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with a slight chance for
M-class flares through 22 Dec. Probabilities increase slightly to 20%
for M-class flares on 23 Dec due to the anticipated return of old active
regions.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 7,320 pfu observed. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was
steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels
on 21 Dec, before decreasing to normal to moderate levels on 22 Dec.
The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at background
levels through 22 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
The solar wind environment reflected waning negative polarity CH HSS
influences and possibly the beginnings of a solar sector boundary
crossing. Total field primarily ranged 1-5 nT, but increased to 7 nT
late in the period. The Bz component remained benign while solar wind
speeds gradually decrased to under 400 km/s. Phi was predominantly
positive until late in the period when orientation shifted to the
negative solar sector and then became variable.

.Forecast...
Ambient-like solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 21 Dec.
Enhanced solar wind conditions are likely on 22 Dec due to the
anticipated onset of CIR effects followed by positive polarity CH HSS
influences.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was quiet throughout the period.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to be mostly quiet over 21 Dec.
Active conditions and periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming are
likely on 22 and 23 Dec due to the anticipated onset of CIR effects
followed by positive polarity CH HSS influences.
