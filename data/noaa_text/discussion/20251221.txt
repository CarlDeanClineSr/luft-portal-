Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was at low levels. Region 4317 (N12E67, Cao/beta)
produced most of the C-flare activity observed this period, and
exhibited growth as the region rotated into full view from the east
limb. Growth was also observed in Regions 4311 (N04W48, Cro/beta) and
4316 (S07E33, Dso/beta), while the remaining regions were either stable
or in decay. No Earth-directed CMEs were detected in available
coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with a slight chance for
M-class flares through 23 Dec.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 7,320 pfu observed. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was
steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to be at normal to
moderate levels on 21-23 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is
expected to persist at background levels through 23 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
The solar wind environment became enhanced this period with the onset of
CIR effects beginning at around 21/0000 UTC. Total magnetic field
strength reached a peak of 15 nT, and the Bz component briefly reached
as far southward as -12 nT. Solar wind speeds increased from a low of
around 450 km/s to a peak near 650 km/s. Phi was mostly positive
throughout the period.

.Forecast...
Enhanced solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 21-23 Dec
due to CIR effects followed by positive polarity CH HSS influences.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached active levels this period in response to
CIR effects.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to reach active levels, with a chance
for G1 (Minor) storm periods, on 21 Dec in response to CIR effects
followed by positive polarity CH HSS influences. Periods of G1 (Minor)
storming are likely, with a chance for G2 (Moderate) storm periods, on
21-22 Dec under persistent CH HSS influences.
