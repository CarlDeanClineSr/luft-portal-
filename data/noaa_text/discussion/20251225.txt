Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was at low levels. Only low level C-class flaring was
observed from Regions 4317 (N12E14, Eai/beta-gamma), 4319 (S09E37,
Dro/beta), and 4321 (S10W16, Dai/beta-delta). Region 4317 exhibited
decay in its trailing spots and consolidation of the leader spots.
Region 4321 continued to grow and appears to have developed a delta
magnetic configuration. New flux emergence was observed in the NW
quadrant and was numbered 4322 (N13W56, Cro/beta). The rest of the
numbered regions were either stable or in decay.

No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with an increasing chance
for M-class flares over 25-27 Dec due to the return of old Regions 4294
(S15, L=284) and 4296 (S15, L=272).

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 7,350 pfu observed at 24/1555 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
25-27 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 27 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters were enhanced but in decline as CH HSS effects
began to diminish. Solar wind speed decreased from approximately 700
km/s to near 600 km/s. Total field ranged from 1-6 nT while the Bz
component was between +3/-5 nT. Phi angle was mostly positive.

.Forecast...
Enhanced solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 25 Dec as
influence from the positive polarity coronal hole persists. Waning
conditions are expected on 26-27 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached unsettled to active levels due to effects
from a positive polarity coronal hole.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to reach active conditions on 25 Dec,
under continued CH HSS effects. Quiet to unsettled levels are expected
on 26 Dec under waning HSS conditions, becoming mostly quiet on 27 Dec.
