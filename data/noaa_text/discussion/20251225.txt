Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity continued at low levels. The largest flare was a C4.9
observed at 24/1021 UTC from Region 4317 (N11E22, Eai/beta-gamma). The
region showed some consolidation in its intermediate spots. Slight
growth was observed in Region 4319 (S09E40, Cro/beta). New Region 4321
(S10W08, Dai/beta-gamma-delta) was numbered. This region continued to
develop rapidly, now with a large asymmetric leading spot.

No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with an increasing chance
for M-class flares over 25-27 Dec due to the return of old Regions 4294
(S15, L=284) and 4296 (S15, L=272).

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 7,350 pfu observed at 24/1555 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
25-27 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 27 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters continued to be influenced by a positive polarity
CH HSS. Solar wind speed was relatively steady around 625-700 km/s.
Total field ranged from 3-6 nT while the Bz component was between +5/-6
nT. Phi angle was mostly positive.

.Forecast...
Enhanced solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 25 Dec as
influence from the positive polarity coronal hole persists. Waning
conditions are expected on 26-27 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached unsettled to active levels due to effects
from a positive polarity coronal hole.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to reach active conditions on 25 Dec,
under continued CH HSS effects. Quiet to unsettled levels are expected
on 26 Dec under waning HSS conditions, becoming mostly quiet on 27 Dec.
