Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity reached moderate levels. Region 4316 (S08E17, Dai/gamma)
produced an M1.3 flare at 21/1827 UTC, the strongest of the period, and
the region development additional spots and grew more magnetically
complex this period. Region 4317 (N11E58, Dai/beta) produced low-level
C-flare activity and exhibited slight growth among the trailer spots.
New Region 4318 (N05E61, Cro/beta) was numbered, but was otherwise
unremarkable. The remaining regions were either stable or in decay.

Other notable activity included a CME, first visible in LASCO C2 imagery
off the east at around 22/0448 UTC, associated with a filament eruption
near Region 4317 at 22/0846 UTC. Analysis of this CME is underway.

Another filament eruption, centered near S12E40 at ~22/0845 UTC,
appeared to produce a CME in SUVI imagery, however, no coronagraph
imagery is yet available for this event.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with an increasing chance
(30-40%) for M-class flares over 22-24 Dec.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 1,570 pfu observed. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was
steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to be at normal to
moderate levels on 22-23 Dec, with high levels likely on 24 Dec. The
greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at background
levels through 24 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
The solar wind environment remained enhanced this period with CIR
effects early in the period, followed by the onset of positive polarity
CH HSS influences. Total magnetic field strength (Bt) decreased from a
peak of 13 nT to around 7 nT, and the Bz component briefly reached -11
nT early in the period. Solar wind speeds gradually increased from a low
of around 575 km/s to a peak near 800 km/s. Phi was positive throughout
the period.

.Forecast...
Enhanced solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 22-24 Dec
due to persistent positive polarity CH HSS influences, and possible
influences from a CME (from 20 Dec) that is expected to pass in close
proximity to Earth on 24 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached G1 (Minor) storm levels this period in
response to CIR effects followed by the onset of positive polarity CH
HSS influences.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is likely to reach G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm
levels on 22-23 Dec due to persistent positive polarity CH HSS
influences. Periods of active conditions are likely on 24 Dec under
waning positive polarity CH HSS influences, and possible influences from
a CME (from 20 Dec) that is expected to pass in close proximity to
Earth.
