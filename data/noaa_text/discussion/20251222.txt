Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity reached moderate levels with an M1.3 at 21/1827 from
Region 4316 (S08E26, Dri/beta), which has been exhibiting rapid flux
emergence on the western edge of its leading spot. Region 4317 (N11E64,
Cao/beta) produced most of the C-flare activity observed this period,
and continued to exhibit growth though confidence in its classification
is low due to foreshortening effects. The remaining regions were either
stable or in decay.

No Earth-directed CMEs were detected in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to be at low levels with a slight chance (20%)
for M-class flares through 23 Dec, with 24 Dec increasing to a chance
(30%).

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 1,570 pfu observed. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was
steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to be at normal to
moderate levels on 21-23 Dec, with a possible threshold crossing on 24
Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 24 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
The solar wind environment became enhanced this period with the onset of
CIR effects beginning at around 21/0000 UTC. Total magnetic field
strength (Bt) reached a peak of 15 nT, with the Bz component showing an
almost periodic oscillation between +/- 10 nT for several hours before
decreasing to roughly +/- 3 nT. Solar wind speeds increased from a low
of around 450 km/s to a peak near 700 km/s. Phi was mostly positive
throughout the period.

.Forecast...
Enhanced solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 22-24 Dec
due to CIR effects followed by positive polarity CH HSS influences.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached G1 (Minor) storming levels this period in
response to CIR effects.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to continue reaching active levels
22-24 Dec, due to persistent CH HSS influences. Periods of G1 (Minor)
storming are likely, with a chance for G2 (Moderate) storm periods, on
22-23 Dec.
