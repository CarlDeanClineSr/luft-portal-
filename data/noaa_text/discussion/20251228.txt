Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity reached high levels due to an M5.1 flare (R2-Moderate) at
27/0150 UTC from the newly numbered Region 4325 (S09E58, Dao/beta). This
flare was also associated with a Type II radio burst (estimated velocity
of 788 km/s), a Tenflare (190 sfu), and a CME eruption. The modeled
propagation path of that CME does not indicate any impact near-Earth. 

Other activity included a C9.9 flare at 27/2233 UTC from Region 4317
(N12W21, Ekc/beta). Regions 4317 and 4321 (S10W50, Dkc/beta-gamma-delta)
grew in magnetic complexity and penumbral area, while other regions
remained stable or showed slight decay during the day. No Earth-directed
CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is likely to reach moderate to high levels (R1-R2) on
28-30 Dec due to the flare potential of the current active regions
presented in the visible solar disk, with a slight chance for X-class
flares during the upcoming 3-day period.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux measured at geostationary orbit
reached high levels with a peak flux of 6,120 pfu observed at 27/1555
UTC. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux remained at background levels
during the period.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to remained at high
levels through 28 Dec, with normal to moderate levels expected on 29
Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain at
background levels through 30 Dec, with a slight chance for a flux above
the threshold of 10 pfu due to the flaring potential of the active
regions on the visible solar disk.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters reflected waning positive polarity CH HSS
influences. Wind speeds slowly decreased from about 500 km/s to 460
km/s, total interplanetary magnetic field strength averaged near 5 nT,
and the Bz component ranged between +2/-5 nT. Phi was predominantly
positive.

.Forecast...
Mostly ambient solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 28-30
Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was quiet throughout the period.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to remain at mostly quiet levels, with
a possibility for unsettled periods, on 28-30 Dec.
