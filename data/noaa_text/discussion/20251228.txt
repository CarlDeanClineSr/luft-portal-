Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was at low levels. Region 4317 (N12W28, Cao/beta)
produced a C9.9 flare, the largest flare of the period, at 27/2233 UTC.
This region exhibited separation of its main leader spots with most of
the trailer spots showing decay. Region 4321 (S10W56,
Dkc/beta-gamma-delta) continued to increase the number of intermediate
spots, becoming compact in its interior. Regions 4324 (N25E58, Dao/beta)
and 4325 (S10E50, Dao/beta) both grew in area and spot count, with each
adding a couple of low-level C-class flares. The remaining regions
remained stable or showed slight decay during the day. No Earth-directed
CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be at low levels, with a chance for
M-class flares (R1/R2 Minor-Moderate) on 28-30 Dec due to the flare
potential of the current active regions. There is a slight chance for
X-class (R3-Strong) flares during the 3-day period.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux measured at geostationary orbit
reached high levels with a peak flux of 6,120 pfu observed at 27/1555
UTC. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux remained at background levels
during the period.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to remained at high
levels through 28 Dec, with normal to moderate levels expected on 29-30
Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to remain at
background levels through 30 Dec, with a slight chance for a flux above
the threshold of 10 pfu due to the flaring potential of the active
regions on the visible solar disk.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters reflected near-background conditions. Wind speeds 
decreased slightly from about 510 km/s to ~450 km/s, total
interplanetary magnetic field strength averaged near 6-7 nT, and the Bz
component ranged between +/-5 nT. Phi was predominantly positive.

.Forecast...
Mostly ambient solar wind conditions are expected to prevail over 28-30
Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was mostly quiet with an isolated unsettled
period.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to remain at mostly quiet levels, with
possible unsettled periods, on 28-30 Dec.
