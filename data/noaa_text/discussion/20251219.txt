Solar Activity

.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was at low levels. Region 4312 (N19E53, Hsx/alpha)
remained unchanged throughout the period, while the remaining regions
were seen to be in decay. No Earth-directed CMEs were detected in
available coronagraph imagery.

.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to continue at low levels over 19-21 Dec.

Energetic Particle

.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 2,690 pfu observed. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux was
steady at background levels.

.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is expected to reach high levels on
19-21 Dec. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to persist at
background levels through 21 Dec.

Solar Wind

.24 hr Summary...
The solar wind environment was mildly enhanced under persistent negative
polarity CH HSS influences. Total field strength reached 8 nT early in
the period, and the Bz component ranged between +/-5 nT. Wind speeds
slowly decreased from ~615 km/s to ~530 km/s throughout the period.

.Forecast...
The solar wind environment is expected to remain mildly enhanced over
19-20 Dec as negative polarity CH HSS influences diminish. Background
conditions are expected to prevail on 21 Dec.

Geospace

.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was quiet and unsettled under persistent negative
polarity CH HSS influences.

.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is expected to be quiet and unsettled on 19-20 Dec
as negative polarity influences diminish. Mostly quiet conditions are
expected to prevail over 21 Dec.
