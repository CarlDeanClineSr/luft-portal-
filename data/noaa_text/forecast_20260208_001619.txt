A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 07-Feb 09 2026 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

             Feb 07       Feb 08       Feb 09

21-00UT       3.67         3.67         3.67     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely on 08 Feb due to
the anticipated arrival of a CME (from 03 Feb), combined with the onset
of new negative polarity CH HSS influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 07-Feb 09 2026

              Feb 07  Feb 08  Feb 09
S1 or greater   25%     25%     25%

Rationale: There is a chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation
storms over 07-09 Feb due to the eruptive potential and location of
Region 4366.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 07-Feb 09 2026

              Feb 07        Feb 08        Feb 09
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
chance for R3 (Strong) or greater events, over 07-09 Feb, primarily due
to the eruptive potential of Region 4366.
