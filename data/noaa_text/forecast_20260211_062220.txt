A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 11-Feb 13 2026 is 2.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 11-Feb 13 2026

             Feb 11       Feb 12       Feb 13

21-00UT       1.67         1.67         1.67     

Rationale: Isolated G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are possible on 11 Feb
due to lingering influence from embedded transients.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 11-Feb 13 2026

              Feb 11  Feb 12  Feb 13
S1 or greater   25%     20%     15%

Rationale: There is decreasing potential for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms through 13 Feb due to the eruptive potential of active
regions leaving the visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 11-Feb 13 2026

              Feb 11        Feb 12        Feb 13
R1-R2           65%           65%           55%
R3 or greater   25%           20%           15%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
decreasing chance of R3 (Strong) or greater events through 13 Feb due to
the eruptive potential of active regions leaving the visible disk.
