A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 21-Feb 23 2026 is 5.00 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 21-Feb 23 2026

             Feb 21       Feb 22       Feb 23
00-03UT       4.33         1.67         2.33

18-21UT       2.00         1.33         4.67 (G1)
21-00UT       2.33         1.67         5.00 (G1)

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming periods are likely on 23 Feb
due to recurrent, negative polarity CH HSS effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 21-Feb 23 2026

              Feb 21  Feb 22  Feb 23
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 21-Feb 23 2026

              Feb 21        Feb 22        Feb 23
R1-R2            5%            5%           10%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for R1 (Minor) or greater radio
blackouts on 23 Feb with the anticipated return of old active regions
to the eastern limb.
