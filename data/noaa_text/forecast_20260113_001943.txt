A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 12-Jan 14 2026 is 4.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected. 

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 12-Jan 14 2026

              Jan 12  Jan 13  Jan 14
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Jan 11 2026 2314 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 12-Jan 14 2026

              Jan 12        Jan 13        Jan 14

R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
over 12-14 Jan due to the flare potential of an eruptive region on the
Suns E limb.
