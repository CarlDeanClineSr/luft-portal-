A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Jan 04-Jan 06 2026 is 4.67 (NOAA Scale
G1).

21-00UT       3.67         3.00         3.00     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 04 Jan due to the
anticipated effects of passing CME that left the Sun on 02 Jan.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 04-Jan 06 2026

              Jan 04  Jan 05  Jan 06
S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There exists a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms over 04-06 Jan due to the eruptive potential of
multiple regions on the visible disk.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Jan 04-Jan 06 2026

              Jan 04        Jan 05        Jan 06
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts,
with a slight chance for R3 (Strong), over 04-06 Jan due to the flare
potential of multiple regions on the visible disk.
