Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 354 Issued at 2200Z on 20 Dec 2025

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 19/2100Z to
20/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. There are currently 6 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a slight chance for an M-class flare on days one, two, and three (21
Dec, 22 Dec, 23 Dec).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 19/2100Z to 20/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 511 km/s at 19/2100Z. Total IMF reached 5 nT at
20/1752Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -3 nT at
20/1236Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 7317 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on day one (21 Dec), quiet to minor storm levels
on day two (22 Dec) and unsettled to minor storm levels on day three (23
Dec).
