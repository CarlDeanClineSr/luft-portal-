Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 353 Issued at 2200Z on 19 Dec 2025

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 18/2100Z to
19/2100Z: Solar activity has been at moderate levels for the past 24
hours. There are currently 3 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be low on days
one, two, and three (20 Dec, 21 Dec, 22 Dec).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 18/2100Z to 19/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 906 km/s at 18/2313Z. Total IMF reached 5
nT at 19/0537Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -4 nT at
19/0054Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 3239 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on day one (20 Dec), quiet levels on
day two (21 Dec) and quiet to minor storm levels on day three (22 Dec).
