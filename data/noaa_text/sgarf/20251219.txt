Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 352 Issued at 2200Z on 18 Dec 2025

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 17/2100Z to
18/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
There are currently 5 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a slight chance for an M-class flare on days one, two, and three (19
Dec, 20 Dec, 21 Dec).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 17/2100Z to 18/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to minor storm levels for the past 24 hours.
Solar wind speed reached a peak of 723 km/s at 18/0659Z. Total IMF
reached 7 nT at 17/2227Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached
-7 nT at 17/2232Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit
reached a peak level of 2693 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to unsettled levels on days one and two (19 Dec, 20 Dec)
and quiet levels on day three (21 Dec).
