Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 357 Issued at 2200Z on 23 Dec 2025

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 22/2100Z to
23/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
There are currently 7 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares on days one, two, and three (24 Dec, 25 Dec,
26 Dec).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 22/2100Z to 23/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at unsettled to active levels for the past 24 hours.
Solar wind speed reached a peak of 907 km/s at 23/1631Z. Total IMF
reached 7 nT at 22/2307Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached
-5 nT at 23/1710Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit
reached a peak level of 5557 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at unsettled to active levels on day one (24 Dec), quiet to active
levels on day two (25 Dec) and quiet to unsettled levels on day three
(26 Dec).
