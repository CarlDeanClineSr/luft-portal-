A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 17-Feb 19 2026 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 17-Feb 19 2026

              Feb 17  Feb 18  Feb 19
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 17-Feb 19 2026

              Feb 17        Feb 18        Feb 19
R1-R2           10%           10%           10%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: Solar activity is expected to be at low levels, with a slight
chance for M-class (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) flares through 19 Feb.
